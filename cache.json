It continues to be a helluva ride, and I so look forward to all that lies ahead. Thank you, Spring team, for everything. Also, sort of coincidentally, I just got a nice promotion. (Thanks, Spring team and VMware). I’m also just about to hit 60,000 followers on Twitter.

Unfortunately, much of the staff’s time is spent making sure that the infrastructure as code (IaC) implementation is in compliance with the standards and policies that his company has for cloud resources. Nelson said, “Oftentimes the code works, but doesn’t conform to naming conventions, or is missing labels, or has security issues, which impacts downstream workflows and applications. We need the environment to conform to our policies, and I don’t want my staff burning cycles to ensure that this is the case.” This was the reason why he brought me in to run a proof of concept (POC).

Training DNNs involves minimizing a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the ground truth labels and the model’s predictions. Training is carried out by backpropagation, which adjusts the model weights via gradient descent steps. Gradient descent, in turn, updates the weights by using the gradient (i.e., derivative) of the loss with respect to the weights. \nThe simplest weight update corresponds to stochastic gradient descent, which, in every step, moves the weights…",

          "description": "Posted by Danijar Hafner, Student Researcher, Google Research \nResearch into how artificial agents can make decisions has evolved rapidly through advances in deep reinforcement learning. Compared to generative ML models like GPT-3 and Imagen, artificial agents can directly influence their environment through actions, such as moving a robot arm based on camera inputs or clicking a button in a web browser. While artificial agents have the potential to be increasingly helpful to people, current methods are held back by the need to receive detailed feedback in the form of frequently provided rewards to learn successful strategies. For example, despite large computational budgets, even powerful programs such as AlphaGo are limited to a few hundred moves until receiving their next reward. \nIn co…",

Today’s visual search tools make it possible to search with your camera, voice, text, images, or multiple modalities at the same time. However, it remains difficult to input subjective concepts, such as visual tones or moods, into current systems. For this reason, we have been working collaboratively with artists, photographers, and image researchers to explore how machine learning (ML) might enable people to use expressive queries as a way of visually exploring datasets. \nToday, we are i…",

Better code optimization can significantly reduce the operational cost of large datacenter applications. The size of compiled code matters the most to mobile and embedded systems or software deployed on secure boot partitions, where the compiled binary must fit in tight code size budgets. With advances in the field, the headroom has been heavily squeezed with increasingly complicated heuristics, impeding maintenance and further improvements.  \n Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can unlock more opportunities in compiler optimization by replacing complicated heuri…",
