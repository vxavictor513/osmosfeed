Unfortunately, the result is a large array of disparate data silos that were never designed to interact with each other.\n\nWhat’s needed is the ability to collect and ingest data from multiple disparate sources and bring them together within a common access layer, in a format that allows cross-correlation and analysis, at scale and in near real-time.

Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…",
