Spring Boot 3, I’ve written about in abundance so I won’t rehash that. If you want to learn more about some of the amazing new features in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, perhaps check out my Spring Tips installment introducing them in this episode:\n\r\n\r\nAnd, of course, a major new feature in Spring Boot 3 is the new ahead-of-time (AOT) engine, about which I speak at great length in tomorrow’s new installment of Spring Tips:\n\r\n\r\nThis video is done so that you can watch the first part as an application developer and get a lot out of it.

A lot of effort and care has been put into this project to ensure a robust foundation for its continued growth. This first major release delivers a full feature set.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring Authorization Server 1.0 is based on Spring Security 6.0, which is based on Spring Framework 6.0 and will require a minimum of JDK 17 at runtime. This major release inherits the VMware Tanzu OSS support policy. Commercial support, which offers an extended support period, is also available from VMware.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTo get started using Spring Authorization Server, see the Getting Started chapter of the reference documentation and the samples, to become familiar with setup and configuration.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nOn behalf of the team, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed and helped grow this project.

For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale.

Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network.
