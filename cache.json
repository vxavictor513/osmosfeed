I started to plan my upcoming cycling trip on Komoot. Planning a one-week trip with six rides is tricky, as you are hovering over the map and trying to find unique routes. Who wants to ride the same road multiple times?\n\nAfter I was done planning in Komoot, I thought to myself: is there a way to identify if I am riding this road once, twice, or even more often? I also wanted to plot it and look at the data a bit more dynamically.\n\nThis is our goal today. Let’s build a dashboard that shows this information.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbd0372ed19956db5/635c2b306b46ec106a2eb7a2/blog-elastic-uniqueroads-1.png,blog-elas…",

In addition, assemblies for common messaging frameworks like Kafka and RabbitMQ, as well as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, can now be automatically instrumented.\nAt the time of the beta release, we posted a detailed technical blog about how auto-instrumentation works in the next iteration of the Elastic APM .NET Agent.

This is what we call the shared responsibility model in which every part of the cloud, including the hardware, data, configurations, access rights, and operating system, are protected. Depending on the local legislation and the origin of the data that is handled (for instance laws like HIPAA, the GDPR in Europe, or the Californian CCPA),  you may have to enforce strict rules on your environment and log events for audit purposes. AWS CloudTrail will help you to achieve this goal. The service can collect and record any kind of information coming from your environment and store or send the events to a destination for audit.

Image quality assessment (IQA) uses models to build a bridge between an image and a user's subjective perception of its quality. In the deep learning era, many IQA approaches, such as NIMA, have achieved success by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based IQA models are often constrained by the fixed-size input requirement in batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized or cropped to a fixed size shape. This preprocessing is problematic for IQA because images can have very different aspect ratios and resolutions…",

The technique is often used for temporal up-sampling to increase the refresh rate of videos or to create slow motion effects. Nowadays, with digital cameras and smartphones, we often take several photos within a few seconds to capture the best picture. Interpolating between these “near-duplicate” photos can lead to engaging videos that reveal scene motion, often delivering an even more pleasing sense of the moment than the original photos.  \n  \nFrame interpolation between consecutive video frames, which often have small motion, has been studied extensively.
