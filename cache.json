          "description": "It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.\n\r\nToday I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.\n\r\nNote that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.\n\r\nIf you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!",

          "description": "For quite some time now, Hibernate has offered a Multitenant feature.\r\nIt integrates nicely with Spring, but there is not much information about how to actually set it up, so I thought an example or two or three could help.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is already an excellent blog article, but it is a little dated and it covers a lot of specifics to the business problems the author tried to solve.\r\nThis approach hides a little of the actual integration, which will be the focus of this article.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDo not worry about the code in this post. You can find links to the full code examples at the end of this blog post.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat Does Multitenant Mean?\n\r\n\r\n\r\nImagine you build an application.

It has been just over two years since we initially announced this new project, and we have come a long way since its initial development. The project has a full feature set, and the APIs have stabilized and matured over this time. A lot of effort and care was put into this project to ensure that it can grow and adapt over the next few years.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSpring Authorization Server 1.0 will be based on Spring Security 6.0, which will be based off of Spring Framework 6.0 and will require a minimum of Java 17 at runtime, as well as a minimum of Tomcat 10 or Jetty 11 (for Jakarta EE 9 compatibility).

          "description": ",\nFor decades, the cybersecurity industry has been shrouded in secrecy. This is partly because of the misunderstanding that cybersecurity often relies on obscurity as its primary form of defense. As the thinking goes, if adversaries don’t know about or understand the security controls that security vendors have in place, it will be easier to defend against cyberattacks.\n\nWhile the reasoning may seem sound, it’s based on a dangerous false equivalency, not backed by empirical evidence or historical context. The evidence? Data breach statistics continue to tick upward at an alarming pace. \n\nOrganizations cannot rely on secrecy or static detections to identify threats and successfully stop cyberattacks. These tools are great at detecting a specific identifier for a file, for example, but an ad…",

It may also mean they don’t return to your site the next time they’re looking to purchase. Patience and forgiveness are often in short supply in the ecommerce world.\n\nSo how can you achieve the ruthless efficiency you need to be competitive while also choreographing a customer experience that’s uniquely yours, so buyers come back again and again?

Consistency is also a principle found within Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. With only a few lines of YAML-formatted manifests, thousands of instances can be set up and configured uniformly. While the management of target instances is simple, it is the control node, or where the Ansible execution is initiated, that can  be the most challenging aspect. As Ansible is written in Python, does the machine have the correct version of Python installed?  Are the necessary Python modules installed? Are there any operating system dependencies needed? The list goes on and on.",

That is, most of the work on the company's critical cloud project is being done by consultants and vendors, and not by their team members. Unfortunately, much of the staff’s time is spent making sure that the infrastructure as code (IaC) implementation is in compliance with the standards and policies that his company has for cloud resources. Nelson said, “Oftentimes the code works, but doesn’t conform to naming conventions, or is missing labels, or has security issues, which impacts downstream workflows and applications. We need the environment to conform to our policies, and I don’t want my staff burning cycles to ensure that this is the case.” This was the reason why he brought me in to run a proof of concept (POC). The POC would validate what would become a Policy as Code solution based on one of the common IaC products.",

They struggle with learning to perform long-horizon tasks and reasoning about abstract goals, such as a user prompt like “I just worked out, can you get me a healthy snack?” \nMeanwhile, recent progress in training language models (LMs) has led to systems that can perform a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks with impressive results.

As such, researchers often utilize learning-to-rank (LTR), a set of supervised machine learning techniques that optimize for the utility of an entire list of items (rather than a single item at a time). A noticeable recent focus is on combining LTR with deep learning. Existing libraries, most notably TF-Ranking, offer researchers and practitioners the necessary tools to use LTR in their work.

Increasingly, real-world video applications, such as video captioning, video content analysis, and video question-answering (VideoQA), rely on models that can connect video content with text or natural language. VideoQA is particularly challenging, however, as it requires grasping both semantic information, such as objects in a scene, as well as temporal information, e.g., how things move and interact, both of which must be taken in the context of a natural-language question that holds specific intent.

One challenging type of computer vision problem is instance-level recognition (ILR) — given an image of an object, the task is to not only determine the generic category of an object (e.g., an arch), but also the specific instance of the object (”Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, Paris, France”).  \nPreviously, ILR was tackled using deep learning approaches. First, a large set of images was collected. Then a deep model was trained to embed each image into a high-dimensional space where similar images have similar representations. Finally, the …",

Typically, an application that completes visual tasks for multiple domains would need to build multiple models for each individual domain, train them independently (meaning no data is shared between domains), and then at inference time each model would process domain-specific input data.

Training DNNs involves minimizing a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the ground truth labels and the model’s predictions. Training is carried out by backpropagation, which adjusts the model weights via gradient descent steps. Gradient descent, in turn, updates the weights by using the gradient (i.e., derivative) of the loss with respect to the weights. \nThe simplest weight update corresponds to stochastic gradient descent, which, in every step, moves the weights…",
