I do learn Go to better understand Kubernetes, for example.\r\nOf course, we deal with some primitives and basic structures, first of all.\r\nThen we implement some well-known algorithms like bubble sort, Fibonacci number or sqrt function to get used to the language style and expectations.\r\nAnd now what?\r\nWe have some real use-cases where this or that functionality…",

          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

If the answer to these questions is yes, then Elastic’s Data Exfiltration Detection package can help you identify when critical enterprise data is being stolen and exfiltrated.\nWhat is data exfiltration?\nData exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a device or network. In simple terms, it is a type of data loss — and to enterprises, it may also mean risk exposure. Data exfiltration can be conducted by outsiders of an organization who compromise the network to steal company secrets or credentials. Another way data exfiltration can occur i…",

For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.\nThe structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.\nThere are a few considerations to make such an application work wel…",

It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here \"Security-Behavior Analysis\", can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices.

          "description": "Posted by Posted by Alvin Rajkomar, Research Scientist, and Eric Loreaux, Software Engineer, Google Research  \nToday many people have digital access to their medical records, including their doctor’s clinical notes. However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts. For example, a doctor might write in their clinical notes, “pt referred to pt for lbp“, which is meant to convey the statement: “Patient referred to physical therapy for low back pain.”  Coming up with this translation is tough for laypeople and compu…",
