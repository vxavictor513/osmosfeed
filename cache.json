If attackers gain access to an endpoint, it’s critical for security teams to identify any and all movements they make. To combat this threat, Elastic Security is excited to announce a new lateral movement detection package that makes use of advanced analytics.\n\nIn the past, we explored how we can detect malicious lateral file transfers using commonly abused admin tools, such as SAMBA, SMB/PS Remoting, FTP, SFTP, SSH, and SCP. But we wanted to explore further how to detect fileless malware that attackers use to hijack and compromise systems like the execution of malicious processes and the exploitation of remote services and sessions. \n\nAdversaries frequently try to compromise active Remote Desktop …",

Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. \n \n\nDesigning adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…",

Because societal contexts by nature are dynamic, complex, non-linear, contested, subjective, and highly qualitative, they are challenging to translate into the quantitative representations, methods, and practices that dominate standard machine learning (ML) approaches and responsible AI product development practices.   \n \n\nThe first phase of AI product development is problem understanding, and this phase has tremendous influence over how problems (…",

For example, in the environmental remote sensing domain, periodic learning is often needed to enable nowcasting of environmental changes, such as precipitation patterns or land surface temperature. In the health domain, learning from video measurement has shown to extract (quasi-)periodic vital signs such as atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea episodes.\n\n\n\nApproaches like RepNet highlight the importance of these types of tasks, and present a solution that recognizes rep…",

Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.\n\n\nIn “Symbol tuning improves…",

Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot).
