As usual, it’s been another crazy awesome, and jam-packed week in Spring, so we’ve got a ton of stuff to get to and so very little time in which to do it. Andiamo! \n\r\n\r\n  \nA Bootiful Podcast: Dr. Mark Pollack on Physics, Spring Cloud Data Flow, Spring Data, Spring.NET, Spring XD, and so much more\n\r\n  \nChanging Spring Boot packaging to WAR and deploying to Tomcat and Jetty\n\r\n  \nDiscover Lenovo Innovation at VMworld: Smarter Technology for All\n\r\n  \nHow much faster is Java 17?\n\r\n  \nIn June, Okta’s Matt Raible, Brian Demers and I did a Twitch stream to figure out how to make the Okta Spring Boot starter work with Spring Native. We succeeded! However, it wasn’t easy. Watch our trials and tribulations in this video.\n\r\n  \nCheck out this massive commit kicking off the official Jakarta EE 9 migration within the Spring Framework codebase!\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.0.5 and 2020.0.13 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.1.0-M3 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.10 and 5.2.17 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.6.0-M3 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tips: A Bootiful Look at SpringOne 2021\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.12.0 released\n\r\n  \nVaadin Reaches Version 21\n\r\n  \nWhat are the implications for our applications if we reduced (or halved) the Java object header size ?\n\r\n  \nOracle recently proposed a two year cadence (instead of three) for long term releases. Microsoft’s Martijn Verburg’s onboard with the new proposal. This bodes well! ](https://mail.openjdk.java.net/pi)",
