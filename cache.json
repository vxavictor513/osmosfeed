Her role requires her to partner closely with her respective leadership team and the business to work through HR-related issues as they come up. \n“I’m the front-line person,” Alexis says. “It could be as simple as directing employees  to our HR shared service team and partnering on business objectives and coaching and supporting employees through various HR matters. My main focus is to help align Elastic’s people strategy with the business strategy.”\nBut, to get where she is today, she had to do some soul searching. While in accounting, she asked …",

Of the three pillars of people, process, and technology, it is the latter that we have the most control over and that can make the greatest impact. We recognize that technology alone is not sufficient and must be accompanied by strong processes and skilled personnel. However, the right technology can greatly facilitate and improve the effectiveness of our vulnerability management efforts.\n\nIn this blog post, we will illustrate the value of the Elastic Stack as a data management platform for vulnerability management and demonstrate how we have fully automated the process of retrieving, enriching, and disseminating scan results to various teams.\n\nWhile we are proud of and pleased with our accomplishments, there is still much work to be d…",

For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into.

In many cases these parts must be custom designed, requiring extensive research and development to reach the highest levels of performance.   \n\nIn this post, we highlight one aspect of this supplemental hardware: our superconducting microwave amplifiers.
