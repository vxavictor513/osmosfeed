          "description": ",Cloud data services make a seductive promise to CIOs and CISOs: All your enterprise data is available any time from anywhere, and you can search, run queries, and perform sophisticated analytics without the headaches and costs of maintaining your own data infrastructure. \n\nPulling that off, however, depends on how and where you store your data. To make the right calls, CIOs must consider a number of factors tied to a company’s business needs, application demands, and resources.\nAs more companies accelerate their investment in the cloud — today, roughly half of all corporate data is stored there — many are under pressure to develop a clear framework and strategy for making those decisions. \nHere are a few recommendations that can help guide the process.\n1.

Malware often requires full administrative privileges on a machine to perform more impactful actions, such as adding an antivirus exclusion, encrypting secured files, or injecting code into system processes. Even if the targeted user has administrative privileges, the prevalence of User Account Control (UAC) means that the malicious application will often default to medium integrity, preventing write access to resources with higher integrity levels. Mandatory Integrity Levels (MIC) provides a mechanism for controlling access to securable objects.\nThis work builds…",

Today’s autonomous vehicles and robots are able to capture much of this information through various onboard sensing mechanisms, such as LiDAR and cameras. \n LiDAR is a ubiquitous sensor that uses light pulses to reliably measure the 3D coordinates of objects in a scene, however, it is also sparse and has a limited range — the farther one is from a sensor, the fewer points will be returned.

          "description": "Posted by Matt McEwen, Student Researcher, Google Quantum AI and Lara Faoro, Research Fellow, LPTHE- Sorbonne Université and CNRS (Paris) \nQuantum processors are made of superconducting quantum bits (qubits) that — being quantum objects — are highly susceptible to even tiny amounts of environmental noise. This noise can cause errors in quantum computation that need to be addressed to continue advancing quantum computers. Our Sycamore processors are installed in specially designed cryostats, where they are sealed away from stray light and electromagnetic fields and are cooled down to very low temperatures to reduce thermal noise.  \nHowever, the world is full of high-energy radiation. In fact, there’s a tiny background of high-energy gamma rays and muons that pass through everything around u…",
