We are planning to release a new milestone of Spring Boot 3.0 every two months. M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.\n\r\nIf you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.\n\r\nWe’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.\n\r\nPlease see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.\n\r\nIf you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.\nThanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests. \nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you’re interested in helping out, check out the “ideal for contribution” tag in the issue repository.

This provides a new and much more efficient way to render geospatial data.\nBuilding on developments over several years, Elasticsearch provides users with a mature technology to filter and aggregate geospatial data. Common to the geospatial use case, visualizing high volumes of geospatial data is still a challenging problem, particularly for applications that use map technologies on the front end. Before 7.15, the main pain points were:\n\nRetrieving full geometries from Elasticsearch documents was inefficient, as maps don't generally need the full resolution of all geo shapes \nGeoJSON is not the best technology to render high volumes of complex geospatial data\n\nTo address …",

In their full analysis ([1] [2]), Elastic Security team researchers Andrew Pease, Derek Ditch, and Daniel Stepanic walk users through the Elastic fleet policy, how to collect the beacon, beacon configuration, how to analyze its activity, and how you can set it up in your organization’s environment.\nThese two articles ([1] [2]) are ideal for helping security analysts identify, collect, and configure Cobalt Strike beacon payloads from an endpoint using Elastic. It is often difficult to collect the Cobalt Strike beacon payload from memory and extract its configuration to identify observables and cluster group activities, partially due to the tremendous amount of metadata the beacon’s configurations include.\nThe early stages of an intrusion usually include initial access, execution, persistence, and command-and-control (C2) beaconing. When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected, and it can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary. \nThe information helps threat hunters and analysts monitor Cobalt Strike beaconing activity, but also provides useful indicators of compromise (IoCs) with which to start an investigation.\nIf you don’t have an Elastic Cloud cluster but would like to collect and configure the Cobalt Strike beacon, you can start a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud today.",

In Elasticsearch 7.16, we focused on scale, pushing the limits of Elasticsearch to make search even faster, memory less demanding, and clusters more stable. Along the way, we uncovered a range of dimensions on sharding and in the process sped up Elasticsearch to new heights. \nHistorically, we’ve recommended avoiding creating a gazillion shards in your cluster due to the resource overhead involved.

Arik, Research Scientist, Google Research, Cloud AI Team  \nDeep neural networks (DNNs) provide more accurate results as the size and coverage of their training data increases. While investing in high-quality and large-scale labeled datasets is one path to model improvement, another is leveraging prior knowledge, concisely referred to as “rules” — reasoning heuristics, equations, associative logic, or constraints. Consider a common example from physics where a model is given the task of predicting the next state in a double pendulum system. While the model may learn to estimate the total energy of the system at a given point in time only from empirical data, it will frequently overestimate the energy unless also provided an equation th…",

One major contributing factor is access to abundant labeled datasets, which are used to train highly effective supervised deep learning models. However, in the real-world, these models may encounter samples exhibiting rare conditions that are individually too infrequent for per-condition classification. Nevertheless, such conditions can be collectively common because they follow a long-tail distribution and when taken together can represent a significant portion of cases — e.g., in a recent deep learning dermatological study, hundreds of rare conditions composed around 20%…",

This technique has been traditionally used in the filmmaking and photography industry for image and video editing purposes, e.g., background replacement, synthetic bokeh and other visual effects. Image matting assumes that an image is a composite of foreground and background images, and hence, the intensity of each pixel is a linear combination of the foreground and the background.  \n   \nIn the case of traditional image segmentation, the image is segmented in a binary manner, in which a pixel either belongs to the foreground or background.

Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and forest health — for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, that means there’s a lot of dead wood. Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear. In fact, experts may identify up to 10x as many birds by ear as by sight. \nIn recent years, autonomous recording units (ARUs) have made it easy to capture thousands of hours of audio in forests that could be used to better understand ecosystems and identify critical habitat.
