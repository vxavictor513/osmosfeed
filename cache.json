The memo outlined a logging maturity model with four tiers (E0-3) to guide agencies in their compliance process.\n\nIn the new study, GAO found that agencies “have made progress in preparing for and responding to cyber threats.” At the same time, however, the study noted that 20 of the 23 agencies did not meet M-21-31’s tier 3 advanced event logging (“advanced EL3”) August deadline for tracking, storing, and managing event logs.\n\nThe study highlighted three challenges agencies are facing as they work to meet M-21-31 event logging requirements: \n\n\nLack of staff\n\nEvent logging technical challenges\n\nLimitations in cyber event information sharing\n\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk through these challenges and share how we’ve seen federal customers address them using Elasticsearch®.\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

This makes logs a notoriously noisy observability signal whose rate can swing wildly with errors and scale.\n\nThe simplicity of the log line as an observability signal (fundamentally, it’s just text!) makes it deceivingly simple to observe.

The right MSP not only provides deep technical expertise and 24/7 monitoring and management of your infrastructure, but it can also improve core operational and procedural challenges over time to help you reduce costs and streamline operations, so your IT team can focus on projects that accelerate your business.\nReady to engage with an Elastic Verified MSP?,\nWhether you want to leverage Elastic within your data center or via the cloud, here are eight areas to consider when selecting a MSP:\n\nSupport: Ensure that your preferred MSP offers 24/7 support and security operation center(s) across time zones.\n\nPricing: Review pricing models to make sure it fits within your resources.\n\nBreadth of services: Consider your needs today, but also what you might need in one, three, or five years. Choose an MSP with a wide range of services so you’re able to grow together and build a lasting partnership. \n\nCloud or hybrid posture: What is your current environment? Make sure your MSP supports your model.\n\nService offerings: Inquire about additional offerings, like consulting or migration services.\n\nReferences: Ask to see validated customer references and testimonials.\n\nCertifications and clearances: If your industry is regulated, ensure that your MSP has the right certifications and clearances. \n\nVerified: Consider choosing an MSP who is Elastic Verified. This ensures the MSP has the correct architecture design, proof of 24/7 support, Elastic-certified engineers, successful customer deployments, and more.\n\nOur current list of our Verified MSP partners includes:",

In many cases, even the current leading models either generate small motion or, when producing larger motions, exhibit noticeable artifacts.\n \n\nTo explore the application of language models in video generation, we introduce VideoPoet, a large language model (LLM) that is capable of a wide variety of video generation tasks, including text-to-video, image-to-video, video stylization, video inpainting and outpainting, and video-to-audio.

Of those few examples, the majority of them involve simulating physical systems that are inherently quantum mechanical — a natural application for quantum computers. But what about simulating systems that are not inherently quantum? Can quantum computers offer an exponential advantage for this?\n\n \n\nIn “Exponential quantum speedup in simulating coupled classical oscillators”, published in Physical Review X (PRX) and presented at the Symposium on Foundations of Computer …",

However, because of uncertainties about processes that are small in scale yet globally important, such as clouds and ocean turbulence, these models’ predictions of upcoming climate changes are not very accurate in detail. For example, predictions of the time by which the global mean surface temperature of Earth will have warmed 2℃, relative to preindustrial times, vary by 40–50 years (a full human generation) among today’s models. As a result, we do not have the accurate and geographically granular predictions we need to plan resilient infrastructure, adapt supply chains to climate disruption, and assess the risks of…",
