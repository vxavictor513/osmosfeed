Assets can be anything from troops, vehicles, IT equipment, or supplies, and having a way to visualize and track assets can improve the decisions made in tactical scenarios. \nReal-time situational awareness (RTSA) and asset tracking go hand in hand. Fast, accurate asset tracking can be enabled by RTSA capabilities such as monitoring, managing, and responding to dynamic situations (including real-time monitoring of data points), aggregating and analyzing large volumes of data, and integrating multiple streams into a common location for visualization and decision-making.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blta8550540dbe…",

These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature.

Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.\nAgain, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments.

The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications.

Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM.
