My family and I love Hawaii. It’s brimming with beauty and serenity, and while the island of Maui, in the state of Hawaii, is very small, the islands are humbling. They make you feel so very small.

This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.\n\r\nWe’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!\n\r\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili\n\r\n  \nDistributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger\n\r\n  \nIngress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes\n\r\n  \nInstantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations\n\r\n  \nCurious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article\n\r\n  \nI put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.\n\r\n  \nSpring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available\n\r\n  \nPushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry\n\r\n  \nSpring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available\n\r\n  \nThis Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!",

          "description": "I am pleased to announce that the release candidate Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9.0 is now available (2.9.0-RC1) in the Spring Milestone Repo.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version is not provided by Spring Boot dependency management, but it can be used with Boot 2.7 (or 2.6), as long as you override the Kafka dependencies as described in this appendix, especially if you are using the embedded Kafka broker.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version uses the 3.2.0 kafka-clients version\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-blocking retry bootstrapping is now more robust\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Error Handler Mode\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, after an error, the DefaultErrorHandler performs seeks on the remaining records from the last poll and re-fetches them from the broker on the next poll.\r\nWith high error rates and large max.poll.records, this can cause unnecessary strain on the network.\r\nFor this reason, the error handler has a new property seekAfterError, when set to false, instead of seeking the records, the remaining records are retained in memory and the consumer paused for the next poll (or multiple polls if the error handler is configured to use the ContainerPausingBackOffHandler).\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPausing Containers\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, when you pause() a container, it actually pauses when all the records from the previous poll have been processed.\r\nThis version adds the pauseImmediate container property, which, when true, causes the container to pause after the current record is processed.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information about all changes in this release, see What’s New.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow | Gitter",

But here in the US we just celebrated the 4th of July, and I, like many Americans, took a long weekend. Took some time with the family to do a little road trip up north to visit Mt. Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a lot of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom! \n\r\n\r\n  \nThe last of my eight part series on building GraphQL applications with Spring for GraphQL is up! Check that page out and find links to all eight videos, each of which introduces one interesting dimension of the powerful and novel new Spring for GraphQL project.\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s installment of A Bootiful Podcast, I talk to Spring Developer Advocate Dan Vega\n\r\n  \nProcessing the Response Body in Spring Cloud Gateway\n\r\n  \nSpring Cloud 2020.0.6 is available\n\r\n  \nUUID as Entity ID in MongoDB\n\r\n  \nI liked this post over on Dzone: Are All Kubernetes Ingresses the Same?\n\r\n  \nWant to learn more about how to build GraalVM native images for Spring Boot 2.x-generation applications? Check out this article I wrote for InfoQ on Spring Native and GraalVM\n\r\n  \nThe good folks over at Vaadin have put together a nice tutorial on building full-stack Spring Boot applications using their Java web framework called Hilla - check it out!\n\r\n  \nour friends over at Sivalabs have put together an interesting looking tutorial on how to use Spring Boot and Kubernetes together\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot team member Stéphane Nicoll did a French-language presentation for DevFest Lille recently introducing Spring AOT",

But today, with the right technology, data streams in real-time — IT leaders can instantly elevate risks and opportunities to their boards.\n\nThis is where observability kicks in with answers. Observability enables organizations to collect metrics, logs, and traces with high dimensionality to detect root causes faster and answer the unknown unknowns. With Application Performance Monitoring (APM) for log, infrastructure, and digital experience monitoring, decision-making becomes less about having a crystal ball and more about having a live view of the state of the enterprise.

Nelson said, “Oftentimes the code works, but doesn’t conform to naming conventions, or is missing labels, or has security issues, which impacts downstream workflows and applications. We need the environment to conform to our policies, and I don’t want my staff burning cycles to ensure that this is the case.” This was the reason why he brought me in to run a proof of concept (POC).
