That trend is also apparent when examining individual department spending. The NAO notes that the Department of Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) spends 76% of their digital budget on maintaining legacy IT.\n\nIn working with government leaders for years, I recognise that modernising legacy IT systems is undoubtedly a daunting endeavour, one which comes with disruption to teams, processes, and even departmental culture. \n\nIt can also be tempting to deem the problem as one limited to only the IT department. In reality, however, legacy IT can significantly compromise the security and operations of your entire organisation. As David Knott, CTO for the UK government, wrote recently on LinkedIn, “The practices used to manage your technology are as fundamental to your business success as the practices you use to manage your people and your processes. If your business is plagued by legacy technology, that is the result of a series of management choices, choices about the importance of infrastructure quality and code quality.”\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim\nadmission validation mechanism within\nthe API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.\nHow to use it?\nAs this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.\nSimply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.\nFor more details, read about\ndefault StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.\n\n\n\nLearning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL).

DP algorithms are randomized to protect user data by ensuring that the probability of any particular output is nearly unchanged when a data point is added or removed. Therefore, the output of a DP algorithm does not disclose the presence of any one data point. There has been significant progress in both foundational research and adoption of differential privacy with contributions such as the Privacy Sandbox and Google Open Source Library.\n\n\nML and data analytics algorithms can often be described as performing multiple basic computation steps on the same dataset.

However, these networks often use large architectures that require lots of computational resources. This can make it impractical to serve such models to users, especially in resource-constrained environments like wearables and smartphones. A widely used approach to mitigate the inference costs of pre-trained networks is to prune them by removing some of their weights, in a way that doesn’t significantly affect utility. In standard neural networks, each weight defines a connection between two neurons. So after weights are pruned, the input…",
