          "description": ",\nAs the world experiences the AI gold rush, organizations are increasingly turning to enterprise AI solutions to gain a competitive edge and unlock new opportunities. However, amid the excitement and potential benefits, one crucial aspect that must not be overlooked is data security — in particular, protecting against adversarial attacks and securing AI models. As businesses embrace the power of AI, they must be vigilant in safeguarding sensitive data to avoid potential disasters. \nIn this blog post, we will delve into the insights from two thought-provoking articles to highlight the top six considerations that organizations should focus on while implementing enterprise AI solutions.\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

Are you concerned that you may not learn about  anomalous behavior until it’s too late? If so, then keep reading to learn how Elastic® can help — but first, let me explain the history behind this.  \nSplunk is good at getting data into the platform, specifically unstructured data from log files and API endpoints. It was built on the design principle of schema on read. The benefit to the schema on read design principle is that it theoretically allows you to quickly onboard any unstructured data source so that you can search it, analyze the results, and subsequently perform some action. The tradeoff that’s realized with schema on read is that it inherently adds latency…",

          "description": ",\nKibana alerting has been around for quite some time, and major work is going on to give you better views into what each rule is doing and where it’s spending its time.\n\nHowever, there are always questions left, where you just want more. Maybe you are an SRE at a company and need to look over hundreds of clusters. Our built-in dashboards might not suffice, as you need a more granular approach.\n\nGood news! We have been working internally to improve the insights you can gather with APM in Kibana®. Simply activate APM for Kibana with a few configuration steps. This will enable Kibana Real User Monitoring (RUM) and Kibana itself. Additionally, you can opt-in to activate Elasticsearch® instrumentation and get a deeper understanding of where Elasticsearch is spending its time.\n\nIf you're intere…",

Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.\n\n\nIn “Symbol tuning improves…",

Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot).

Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging. For instance, when searching for a fashion item, users may want an item whose specific attribute, e.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website.
