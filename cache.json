          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! This last week’s been nutty! Here in the US, we just celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday, and I am fat with turkey and pie, and lazy. But happy. I hope you’re well fed and happy, too. Time’s flying. (Also: can you believe we’re a month away from the new year? I think there’s like four or five weeks (and thus _This Week in Spring_s!) left in the year!) \n\r\nWe’ve got a ton of stuff to get into this week, so let’s go:\n\r\n\r\n  \nSecurity Report for Spring AMQP (Spring for RabbitMQ)\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot 2.6.1 is now available\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB - Relation Modelling\n\r\n  \nThymeleaf 3.0.13 now available! This new version includes security improvements, make sure to check the release notes\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s installmetn of A Bootiful Podcast, I talked about reactive-systems with functional programming legend Debasish Ghosh\n\r\n  \nThe Apache Cassandra project is working hard to officially support JDK 17 in the next Apache Cassandra major release.\n\r\n  \nI love to see how far the JVM has come. One great indicator of its progress: its garbage collector. Check out this post on garbage collection progress from JDK 8 to JDK 17\n\r\n  \nThis is so cool! There’s now an Oracle Database Kubernetes Operator\n\r\n  \nJEP 420: Pattern Matching for switch (Second Preview)\n\r\n  \nJava on Visual Studio Code Update – October 2021\n\r\n  \nFor a lot of folks, the days of using Docker Desktop for free are numbered.

However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  \n An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …",
