Cheery stuff! However, in recent years, we’ve seen an explosion of AI and machine learning technology that, so far, has shown us a fun side with people using AI for creating, planning, and ideating in a big way.\nThese emerging technologies are being used to revolutionize everything from healthcare to entertainment. But as with any new technology, people are still trying to wrap their heads around it. And one of the biggest sources of this confusion comes from the similarities and overlap between two of the key terms in this field: AI and machine learning. So in this article, w…",

In fact, you’d struggle to find tech companies that have not announced AI integrations into their tech stack in one way or another. Cynics might say this is a passing phase, but the reason AI is so popular is that it’s a versatile set of capabilities that can help solve a lot of problems.\nThe most direct way AI can be utilized is in the form of a chatbot: a conversational interface that mimics human interaction, generating contextual responses based on what the user inputs. Sometimes these are text-based, such as the customer service bots you often see on websites or apps. And sometimes they’re voice-enabled, like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa.

          "description": "Author: Sascha Grunert\nSeccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux\nkernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a\nprocess, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the\nkernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles\nOperator solve that problem by\nrunning as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that\ndistribution could be done by the container\nruntime.\nRuntimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:\na…",
