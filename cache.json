We are planning to release a new milestone of Spring Boot 3.0 every two months. M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.\n\r\nIf you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.\n\r\nWe’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.\n\r\nPlease see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.\n\r\nIf you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.\nThanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests. \nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you’re interested in helping out, check out the “ideal for contribution” tag in the issue repository.

This first milestone includes a number of major changes such as requiring Java 17+, migrating to Jakarta EE 9 APIs as well as upgrading our dependencies across the portfolio to major versions such as Spring Framework 6.0. For a complete list of changes, please check the change log.\n\r\nWe also took the opportunity of this major version to remove deprecated APIs and fix some issues that require non backward compatible changes. The migration guide contains more details about these changes and provides the upgrade instructions.\n\r\nAs we continue our work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on this first milestone!\n\r\nSpring Batch Home | Source on GitHub",

Elastic can be deployed across on-premises and cloud environments to help people find what they need faster, monitor mission-critical applications, and protect against cyber threats. \nWhen deciding on the optimal environment to deploy Elastic workloads, there are several essential factors that CIOs, IT managers, and cloud engineers should consider — elasticity, security, cost, reliability, and geographic coverage. \nIn this blog, we will discuss how these five characteristics of cloud computing can be leveraged to maximize your Elastic experience and achieve the best return on your investment.\nOn-demand scalability and elasticity\nCloud computing is scalable, so you can fr…",

It is critical to understand the optimal ways to expand the Elasticsearch cluster so not to impair performance.\nElasticsearch is a fast and powerful search technology. As your data grows you will need to take advantage of it’s impressive scalability. Adding more nodes to a cluster not only increases how much data the cluster can hold, it improves how many requests it handles at once, and reduces the time needed to return results–usually. \nIt makes for one terrible weekend trying to uncover why adding nodes to your Elasticsearch cluster caused instability, downtime, mounting frustration and lost revenue.
