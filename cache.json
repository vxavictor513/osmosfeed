          "description": "In this article, we look into writing a custom extension for Spring Cloud Gateway. Before we get started, let’s go over how Spring Cloud Gateway works:\n\r\n\n\r\n\r\n  \nFirst, a client makes a network request to the Gateway\n\r\n  \nThe Gateway is defined with a number of routes, each with Predicates to match the request to the route. For example, you can match on the path segment of the URL or the HTTP method of the request.\n\r\n  \nOnce matched, the Gateway executes pre-request logic on each of the filters applied to the route. For example, you might want to add query parameters to your request\n\r\n  \nA proxy filter routes the request to the proxied service\n\r\n  \nThe service executes and returns a response\n\r\n  \nThe gateway receives the response and executes post-request logic on each filter before return…",

But what if multiple jobs are defined in the test context? And what if no Job beans are defined at all? So while this autowiring was convenient for most cases, it turned out to cause several issues in the aforementioned situations. In this release, and based on community feedback,…",

They started as organic Slack channels that Elasticians could join to connect with others from similar backgrounds or experiences.\nIn 2021, we formalized these ERGs to ensure that the members would have structure, budget, and ultimately, a voice based on any dimension of diversity, allyship, and advocacy. Formalizing these ERGs was an important step in broadening the impact of our collective diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives.\nERGs are aligned to shared identities, interests, affinities, or allyships and have visions and goals they are working towards.

When using VMware vSphere, it is a common practice to share a standardized VM template and use it to create new VMs. This template is often called a golden image. Its creation involves a series of steps that can be automated with Ansible. In this blog, we will see how one can create and use a new golden image.",

They are not just focusing on the modeling language as such but have workflow systems in mind too. It’s valuable to have a closer look at those patterns and discuss which parts of it can be shown and even automated in BPMN, and which parts are taken care of in the technical implementation. I have seen BPMN diagrams that try to include every aspect in the diagram itself. This often leads to overloaded BPMN models with a lack of clear transparency of the business flow. Therefore, it is important to focus on all aspects of workflow...\nThe post Workflow diagram and pattern examples using BPMN models appeared first on Camunda.",
