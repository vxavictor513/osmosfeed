          "description": ",\nModern computing environments and distributed workforces have produced new challenges to traditional information security approaches. Many traditional threat detection and response strategies rely on homogeneous environments, system baselines, and consistent control implementations. These strategies have been built on traditional environment assumptions that may no longer be true in your environment with the evolution of cloud computing, remote work, and modern culture.\nElastic is distributed by design, from our technology to our workforce. Elasticians are empowered to work where they want, when they want, how they want. This includes what technologies they utilize, what configurations they need, and what software they prefer.

The features discussed in this blog are all currently in beta, and we urge users trying these features out to upgrade to the latest stack version first.

In many cases these parts must be custom designed, requiring extensive research and development to reach the highest levels of performance.   \n\nIn this post, we highlight one aspect of this supplemental hardware: our superconducting microwave amplifiers.
