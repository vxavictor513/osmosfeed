Having a central dashboard to track this data is absolutely essential for uncovering and sharing cybersecurity vulnerabilities before they can do harm to citizens or critical infrastructure.\nThis dashboard — known as the Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM) dashboard — is operated by the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) and centralizes data from over 100 civilian agencies. The CDM program recently reached its 10-year anniversary, which is an impressive milestone for a program that continues to develop and expand.\nCentralizing petabytes of data via Elastic\nWhen you lift up the hood of the CDM dashboard, you’ll see Elastic as the powerhouse providing the…",

          "description": "Posted by Parker Riley, Software Engineer, and Jan Botha, Research Scientist, Google Research  \nMany languages spoken worldwide cover numerous regional varieties (sometimes called dialects), such as Brazilian and European Portuguese or Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese. Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…",

Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. \n\nHowever, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including \"unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation.
