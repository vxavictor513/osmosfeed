          "description": "I am pleased to announce that the release candidate Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9.0 is now available (2.9.0-RC1) in the Spring Milestone Repo.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version is not provided by Spring Boot dependency management, but it can be used with Boot 2.7, as long as you override the Kafka dependencies as described in this appendix, especially if you are using the embedded Kafka broker.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotable Changes\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis version uses the 3.2.0 kafka-clients version\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNon-blocking retry bootstrapping is now more robust\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Error Handler Mode\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, after an error, the DefaultErrorHandler performs seeks on the remaining records from the last poll and re-fetches them from the broker on the next poll.\r\nWith high error rates and large max.poll.records, this can cause unnecessary strain on the network.\r\nFor this reason, the error handler has a new property seekAfterError, when set to false, instead of seeking the records, the remaining records are retained in memory and the consumer paused for the next poll (or multiple polls if the error handler is configured to use the ContainerPausingBackOffHandler).\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPausing Containers\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, when you pause() a container, it actually pauses when all the records from the previous poll have been processed.\r\nThis version adds the pauseImmediate container property, which, when true, causes the container to pause after the current record is processed.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor information about all changes in this release, see What’s New.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow | Gitter",

But here in the US we just celebrated the 4th of July, and I, like many Americans, took a long weekend. Took some time with the family to do a little road trip up north to visit Mt. Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a lot of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom! \n\r\n\r\n  \nThe last of my eight part series on building GraphQL applications with Spring for GraphQL is up! Check that page out and find links to all eight videos, each of which introduces one interesting dimension of the powerful and novel new Spring for GraphQL project.\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s installment of A Bootiful Podcast, I talk to Spring Developer Advocate Dan Vega\n\r\n  \nProcessing the Response Body in Spring Cloud Gateway\n\r\n  \nSpring Cloud 2020.0.6 is available\n\r\n  \nUUID as Entity ID in MongoDB\n\r\n  \nI liked this post over on Dzone: Are All Kubernetes Ingresses the Same?\n\r\n  \nWant to learn more about how to build GraalVM native images for Spring Boot 2.x-generation applications? Check out this article I wrote for InfoQ on Spring Native and GraalVM\n\r\n  \nThe good folks over at Vaadin have put together a nice tutorial on building full-stack Spring Boot applications using their Java web framework called Hilla - check it out!\n\r\n  \nour friends over at Sivalabs have put together an interesting looking tutorial on how to use Spring Boot and Kubernetes together\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot team member Stéphane Nicoll did a French-language presentation for DevFest Lille recently introducing Spring AOT",

Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. \n\r\nAnd, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press! \n\r\n\r\n  \nBootiful Podcast: Spring Framework contributor Sébastien Deleuze on GraalVM, AOT, project Leyden, and WebAssembly\n\r\n  \nCVE report published for Spring Cloud Function\n\r\n  \nDebugging Collections, Streams and Watch Renderers\n\r\n  \nDifference Between Flux.create and Flux.generate\n\r\n  \nHandle Spring Security Exceptions With @ExceptionHandler\n\r\n  \nMongoDB Composite Key With Spring Data\n\r\n  \nSpring Authorization Server 0.3.1 available now\n\r\n  \nMonitoring Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot Admin\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.2.1 and 2021.1.5 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data JPA – Run an App Without a Database\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB SpEL Expression Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22980)\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.21 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.2 and 5.6.6 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.0 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.1 released\n\r\n  \nWhat are the Spring Boot Default Memory Settings?\n\r\n  \nA Guide to Docker Private Registry\n\r\n  \nIs There a Destructor in Java?",

          "description": ",\nAdoption of AWS Lambda functions in cloud-native applications has increased exponentially over the past few years. Serverless functions, such as the AWS Lambda service, provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying infrastructure and orchestration, given these tasks are managed by the cloud provider. Software development teams can then focus on the implementation of business and application logic. \nSome additional benefits include billing for serverless functions based on the actual compute and memory resources consumed, along with automatic on-demand scaling. One difficulty in using serverless functions, however, is making them observable in the wider end-to-end microservices architecture context. \n,Elastic APM for AWS Lambda: The architecture\nIn a previous blog post, we showe…",

This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time.

While artificial agents have the potential to be increasingly helpful to people, current methods are held back by the need to receive detailed feedback in the form of frequently provided rewards to learn successful strategies.
