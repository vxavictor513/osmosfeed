          "description": ",\nWhether referred to as “customer experience” or “citizen experience,” making sure people are satisfied with their digital interactions is a clear priority for the U.S. federal government. In September 2023, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), released the “Delivering a Digital First Public Experience” memorandum (OMB M-23-22). This document offers a policy framework for federal agencies as they continue to optimize online services and experiences. It also reflects growing citizen expectations for their digital interactions with the government.\nFrom a citizen’s perspective, digital experience is an area where the government has significant room for improvement. Only 8% of Americans say the U.S. government is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, according to Pew Research. And a McKinsey study found that the public sector is ranked lowest of 10 industries for customer satisfaction. Undoubtedly contributing to this dissatisfaction is the fact that private sector companies have set the digital bar so high. From online banking to one-click purchasing, frictionless digital interactions have become the norm for many citizens — and in many cases an expectation versus a “nice-to-have.”\nUnlike in many sectors, however, the consequences of a poor customer experience in the public sector can have ramifications beyond lost sales and revenue. The breadth of impact is significant: U.S. federal websites receive about 2 billion visits per month or almost 80 million hours of digital interactions with citizens. A suboptimal digital experience can mean that constituents don’t get access to critical support and services that affect their health and well-being. The U.S. government estimates that $140 billion in potential benefits go unused each year because of “outdated or complicated processes.”\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

Fall leaves are turning colors, families are gearing up for the holidays, and many vendors are releasing different reports during cybersecurity month. Our researchers at Elastic Security Labs released the 2023 Global Threat Report last week after months of analysis on more than 1 billion data points. As the CISO of Elastic®, my team and I leveraged last year’s report findings and predictions to strategize for the changing threat landscape. This year, I expect our team will dig further on the new threat research discoveries and predictions. In particular, my team and I are taking note of the following insights while preparing for the next year. \nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltd4d7f6d74d502420/6536c2f0796b8e0d6b25d24c/figure-2.p…",

These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.\nAgain, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments.

There are a number of reasons why city officials might enact their plan, a primary one being a natural disaster, such as a tornado, flood, or wildfire. An evacuation plan can help the community more effectively respond to an emergency, and so could help save lives. However, it can be difficult for a city to evaluate such a plan because it is not practical to have an entire town or city rehearse a full blown evacuation. For example, Mill Valley, a city in northern California, created a wildfire evacuation plan but lacked an estimate for how long the evacuation would take.\n\n\nToday we describe a c…",

The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications.

They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.\n\n\n\nFor the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems.
