Elasticsearch® also has great lexical retrieval capabilities and rich tools for combining the results of different queries. In this blog, we introduce the concept of hybrid retrieval and explore two concrete implementations available in Elasticsearch. In particular, we explore how to improve the performance of Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder by combining it with BM25 using Reciprocal Rank Fusion and Weighted Sum of Scores.\nWe also discuss experiments we undertook to explore some general research questions. These include how best to parameterize Reciprocal Rank Fusion and how to calibrate Weighted Sum of Scores.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724f…",

One easy-to understand scenario, which we previously blogged about, is the direct OpenTelemetry Protocol (OTLP) support in APM Server. This means that you can connect any OpenTelemetry agent to an Elastic APM Server and the APM Server will happily take that data, ingest it into Elasticsearch®, and you can view that OpenTelemetry data in the APM app in Kibana®.\n\nThis blog post will showcase a different use-case: within Elastic APM, we have our own APM Agents. Some of these have download numbers in the tens of millions, and some of them predate OpenTelemetry.

Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.\n\n\nIn “Symbol tuning improves…",

Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot). However, there is still a significant performance gap between these methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised VQA methods, such as MaMMU…",

Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging. For instance, when searching for a fashion item, users may want an item whose specific attribute, e.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website. Yet searching for the item in an existing search engine is not trivial since precisely describing the fashion item by text can be challenging. To address this fact, composed image retrieval (CIR…",
