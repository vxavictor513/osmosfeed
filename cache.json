          "description": "Dear Spring community,\n\r\nIt is my pleasure to announce that Spring Framework 6.0.0 is generally available from Maven Central now! This is the start of a new framework generation for 2023 and beyond, embracing current and upcoming innovations in OpenJDK and the Java ecosystem. At the same time, we carefully designed it as a straightforward upgrade from Spring Framework 5.3.x for modern-day runtime environments.\n\r\nAs a major revision of the core framework, Spring Framework 6.0 comes with a Java 17+ baseline and a move to Jakarta EE 9+ (in the jakarta namespace), with a focus on the recently released Jakarta EE 10 APIs such as Servlet 6.0 and JPA 3.1. This provides access to the latest web containers such as Tomcat 10.1 and the latest persistence providers such as Hibernate ORM 6.1. Don’t be stuck on Java EE 8, make the leap to the jakarta namespace, ideally straight to the Jakarta EE 10 level! The upcoming Spring Boot 3.0.0 release includes corresponding managed dependencies for you.\n\r\nInfrastructure-wise, 6.0 introduces a foundation for Ahead-Of-Time transformations and the corresponding AOT processing support for Spring application contexts. This enables first-class support for GraalVM native images with Spring Boot 3. You may also explore Project Loom’s virtual threads with Spring applications - see “Embracing Virtual Threads” - and dive into Project CRaC ’s checkpoint restore approach for faster JVM startups, both of which are in preview at this point but expected to become first-class features for Spring Framework 6.x based applications.\n\r\nThere are many further features and refinements available in Spring Framework 6.0, e.g. an HTTP interface client, support for RFC 7807 problem details, and Micrometer-based observability for HTTP clients. Please see our What’s New page for a comprehensive overview and give 6.0.0 an early try!\n\r\nCheers,\nJuergen\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Documentation",

Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use ca…",

          "description": ",\nOn November 5, 2022, at the 2022 Alibaba Cloud Apsara Summit, Elastic won the Alibaba Cloud Product Ecosystem Partner Significant Contribution Award. This award commends and thanks the Partner of Alibaba Cloud for maintaining rapid growth despite the double test of the pandemic and the economy, to promote high-quality development themes of Alibaba cloud. Elastic is the only international partner that has won this honor.\n\n2022 is the new beginning of the second five-year strategic cooperation between Elastic and Alibaba Cloud. The two companies will continue to deepen cooperation in products, services, communities, and ecology to achieve a new leap in high quality.\n,At this conference, the two parties jointly launched the latest Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch serverless version, providing end-to-end data access, data management, data application, and visualization module component capabilities around the Elastic Stack ecological components, as well as scenario-based upper-layer application capabilities. The launch of this version can avoid the complexity of large-scale cluster operation and maintenance, and the cloud native service can achieve second-level elastic scaling without planning and managing cluster resource configuration. By optimizing the cost of computing and storage resources, it can reduce the user's usage cost by 70% on average. This version can efficiently manage and analyze massive data, by decoupling of storage and computing, effectively improve read and write efficiency, and greatly reduce database operation and maintenance management costs.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt84a8ebe85ebdcf28/63764e6371c75510a0c9fcca/blog-elastic-alibaba-apsara.png,blog-elastic-alibaba-apsara.png,\nThe strategic cooperation between Elastic and Alibaba Cloud began in 2017. Currently, the Alibaba Elasticsearch service is available in Alibaba Cloud's service areas in 17 countries and regions, serving thousands of thousands of customers.",

          "description": "In a cloud model, the security of the environment and compliance becomes the responsibility of both the end users and the cloud provider. This is what we call the shared responsibility model in which every part of the cloud, including the hardware, data, configurations, access rights, and operating system, are protected. Depending on the local legislation and the origin of the data that is handled (for instance laws like HIPAA, the GDPR in Europe, or the Californian CCPA),  you may have to enforce strict rules on your environment and log events for audit purposes. AWS CloudTrail will help you to achieve this goal. The service can collect and record any kind of information coming from your environment and store or send the events to a destination for audit. In addition to security and compliance, this service helps keep track of resource consumption.",

Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network. Such models have demonstrated better scaling in multiple domains and…",

Scaling up the size of language models often leads to improved performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks. In many cases, the performance of a large language model can be predicted by extrapolating the performance trend of smaller models. For instance, the effect of scale on language model perplexity has been empirically shown to span more than seven orders of magnitude. \n\nOn the other hand, performance for certain other tasks does not improve in a predictable fashion.

          "description": "Posted by Rishabh Agarwal, Senior Research Scientist, and Max Schwarzer, Student Researcher, Google Research, Brain Team  \nReinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on training intelligent agents using related experiences so they can learn to solve decision making tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons, and designing hardware chips. Due to the generality of RL, the prevalent trend in RL research is to develop agents that can efficiently learn tabula rasa, that is, from scratch without using previously learned knowledge about the problem. However, in practice, tabula rasa RL systems are typically the exception rather than the norm for solving large-scale RL problems. Large-scale RL systems, such as OpenAI Five, which achieves human-le…",

While these programs can be expressive, re-programming policies for each new task can be time consuming, and requires domain expertise.\n\nWhat if when given instructions from people, robots could autonomously write their own code to interact with the world? It turns out that the latest generation of language models, such as PaLM, are capable of complex reasoning and have also been trained on millions of lines of code.
