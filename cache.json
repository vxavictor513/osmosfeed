          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doin’? I’m doin’ alright! Last week I was in Antwerp, Belgium, for the amazing Devoxx BE show. I did a presentation with my friend and hero James Ward on Spring and Kotlin (that was voted third most-liked talk at a show with more than 250 speakers!) That was a personal career highlight for me - it’s not often you get to win and have fun in life. And, as if that wasn’t awesome enough, this week I am in Las Vegas, NV, for JavaOne! Fingers crossed, this week will go smoothly, too! Both Devoxx and JavaOne are the first such shows since at least before the pandemic. It’s been a very long time in coming and I’m elated, overjoyed, to be able to be here.\n\r\nAnd, of course, I’m super excited about SpringOne 2022! Also, the first in-person show of its kind since before the pandemic! It’s going to be amazing. Have you registered? If not, you might consider using this registration code - S1VM22_Advocate_200.\n\r\nAnd this week’s busy roundup reflects the usual flurry of activity on the Spring team as we ready releases for our end-of-November timelines for Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which means we’ve got a ton of stuff to get into this week, so let’s!\n\r\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 6.0 goes RC1\n\r\n  \nObservability with Spring Boot 3\n\r\n  \nA Bootiful Podcast: Google mad scientist Josh Suereth on Observability with OpenTelemetry, building better build tools, and so much more \n\r\n  \nSpring Batch 5.0.0-M8 is out!\n\r\n  \nLearn more about Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 in these two great talks from Devoxx 2022\n\r\n  \nSpring at JavaOne 2022\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2022.0.0-RC1, 2021.2.5, and 2021.1.8 available\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 6.0.0-RC1 and 5.8.0-RC1 are released\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.4 and 5.6.8 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring for GraphQL 1.1.0-RC1 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Web Services 4.0.0-RC1 is out!",

The final GA release is coming next month in anticipation of Spring Boot 3.0 going GA.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0.x is the generation of Spring Web Services that works with Jakarta EE 9, the version where the enterprise specs (JAX-WS, etc.) migrate from javax. to jakarta.. See Juergen Holler’s blog post for more details about that.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing based upon Spring Framework 6.0, this is also the generation of Spring Web Services that is rebased on top of Java 17 (LTS). So check it out!\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details, read the following release notes for each version:\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRelease Notes - Spring Web Services - Version 4.0.0-RC1\n\r\n\r\n\r\n#1284 - Upgrade to Spring…",

          "description": "I’m pleased to announce that the first release candidate of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 due for release later this week.\n\r\nThis release candidate is the last stop for shipping new features; from that point, we’ll be focusing on bug fixes and documentation improvements. Our goal is to stabilize the current branch for our GA release scheduled next month.\n\r\nWith RC1, we’re shipping our new Observability support in Spring for GraphQL. Based on the new Micrometer Observation work, this infrastructure replaces the former GraphQL Metrics support in Spring Boot 2.7. GraphQL is a good use case for Observability in general, as the GraphQL engine can distribute the data fetching operations over caches, databases, REST APIs and more. It’s important not only to keep track of performance metrics for your GraphQL API, but also to be able to explore traces and investigate production issues.\n\r\nWe didn’t have time to tackle features like Pagination/Relay or AOT/Native support, but we’re listening to the community. We’re working on our roadmap for the next feature version, so now is the time to vote on existing issues to show your interest!\n\r\nThe annual Spring survey is here, it’s a great way to let us know what you think!\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow",

          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! I was just at Devoxx in Belgium, where hundreds of experts from across the Java ecosystem converged for the first time since 2019 to deliver their biggest and best. \n\r\nI could do a proper trip report, but I really just came here to point you to two talks from two of my amazing teammates, Stéphane Nicoll (@snicoll) and Brian Clozel (@bclozel), who have been very hard at work on both Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land by the end of November, 2022. These are brand new generations of the framework, implying huge new paradigms and new opportunities for developers. \n\r\nThis first is a broader, whirlwind tour of the new features in Spring Framework 6 (which bubble up into Spring Boot 3).\n\r\n\r\nThis second one introduces the new ahead-of-time (AOT) support in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, which makes it trivial to build GraalVM native images.\n\r\n\n\r\nNB: please ignore the metadata for the YouTube videos. Both talks feature both speakers, and there is no mention whatsoever of React and JavaScript and the like. I think that was a metadata issue with the publication of the videos on YouTube, which will hopefully be resolved. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\nIf you missed this event, that’s OK - there’s still time to join the Spring team and larger Java ecosystem for SpringOne, being held 6-8 December, 2022, in sunny San Francisco, CA, 94105!

          "description": "On behalf of the team and all contributors, I am pleased to announce that Spring Batch 5.0.0-M8 is now available from our milestone repository.\n\r\nIn this milestone, we introduced two main changes:\n\r\n\r\n  \nNew default execution context serialization format\n\r\n  \nSystemCommandTasklet enhancements\n\r\n\r\nThis blog post walks through these two major changes in details. For the complete list of changes,\nplease check the release notes.\nNew default execution context serialization format\n\r\nIn this milestone release, the DefaultExecutionContextSerializer was updated to serialize/deserialize the context to/from Base64.\n\r\nMoreover, the default ExecutionContextSerializer configured by @EnableBatchProcessing or DefaultBatchConfiguration was changed from JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer to DefaultExecutionContextSerializer. The dependency to Jackson was made optional. In order to use the JacksonExecutionContextStringSerializer, jackson-core should be added to the classpath.\nSystemCommandTasklet enhancements\n\r\nThe SystemCommandTasklet has been revisited in this release and was changed as follows:\n\r\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \nA new strategy interface named CommandRunner was introduced in order to decouple the command execution from the tasklet execution. The default implementation is the JvmCommandRunner which uses the java.lang.Runtime#exec API to run system commands. This interface can be implemented to use any other API to run system commands.\n\r\n  \n\r\n  \nThe method that runs the command now accepts an array of Strings representing the command and its arguments. There is no need to tokenize the command or do any pre-processing anymore. This change makes the API more intuitive, and less prone to errors.\n\r\n\nFeedback\n\r\nI would like to thank all contributors who had a role in this release! As we continue\nour work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on Github, Twitter and StackOverflow.\n\r\n\r\nSpring Batch Home|Source on Github|Reference documentation",

This means it’s syntactically closer to code than human-readable sentences. Since one of the goals of FEEL is to be “process analyst friendly,” it prioritizes readability more than other expression...\nThe post Using FEEL with Camunda 8 appeared first on Camunda.",

To counter these challenges, more and more organizations are evolving their organizational structures accordingly, often creating Centers of Excellence (CoE) and/or communities of practice (CoP). Please note that during this post we will use the term CoE, but keep in mind your organization might call this very differently. That said, in Camunda Platform 8, we included new functionalities that will help companies to scale process automation successfully.  This blog post discusses different aspects of scaling process automation, the role of CoEs, and how new Camunda 8 features support those initiatives.  What does scaling mean?

If your organization has multiple teams working on different parts of a larger system, then microservices can serve as a separation of concerns that map an independent, encapsulated service to a specific team. These teams have clear boundaries of responsibility and can deploy on their own schedule. These factors lend themselves to a polyglot approach.
