          "description": ",\nAccording to the National Audit Office (NAO), more than 25% of the UK government’s total digital budget is being spent on reducing legacy IT and cybersecurity. That trend is also apparent when examining individual department spending. The NAO notes that the Department of Food and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) spends 76% of their digital budget on maintaining legacy IT.\n\nIn working with government leaders for years, I recognise that modernising legacy IT systems is undoubtedly a daunting endeavour, one which comes with disruption to teams, processes, and even departmental culture. \n\nIt can also be tempting to deem the problem as one limited to only the IT department. In reality, however, legacy IT can significantly compromise the security and operations of your entire organisation. As David Knott, CTO for the UK government, wrote recently on LinkedIn, “The practices used to manage your technology are as fundamental to your business success as the practices you use to manage your people and your processes. If your business is plagued by legacy technology, that is the result of a series of management choices, choices about the importance of infrastructure quality and code quality.”\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

We want your feedback so that we can graduate this feature as soon as possible.\nThe concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. In 2015, sidecars were described in a blog post about composite containers as additional containers that “extend and enhance the ‘main’ container”. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without n…",

Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim\nadmission validation mechanism within\nthe API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.\nHow to use it?\nAs this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.\nSimply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.\nFor more details, read about\ndefault StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

However, modern object detectors are limited by the manual annotations of their training data, resulting in a vocabulary size significantly smaller than the vast array of objects encountered in reality. To overcome this, the open-vocabulary detection task (OVD) has emerged, utilizing image-text pairs for training and incorporating new category names at test time by associating them with the image content. By treating categories as text embeddings, open-vocabulary detectors can predict a wide range of unseen objects. Various techniqu…",

Nonetheless, a long standing debate has been whether LLMs can reason symbolically (i.e., manipulating symbols based on logical rules). For example, LLMs are able to perform simple arithmetic operations when numbers are small, but struggle to perform with large numbers. This suggests that LLMs have not learned the underlying rules needed to perform these arithmetic operations. \n\n\n\nWhile neural networks have powerful pattern matching capabilities, they are prone to overfitting to spurious statistical patterns in the data.
