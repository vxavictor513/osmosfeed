One of the key messages in M-21-31 is the need to keep log data actionable for longer time periods to help detect and mitigate hidden attacks and avoid situations like the SolarWinds breach of 2021.\nAs agencies examine the capabilities of their logging solutions in light of M-21-31, that actionable data is crucial.

The ability to reason on new tasks is mostly credited to training models on a wide variety of unique instructions, known as “instruction tuning”, which was introduced by FLAN and extended in T0, Super-Natural Instructions, MetaICL, and InstructGPT.

However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts. For example, a doctor might write in their clinical notes, “pt referred to pt for lbp“, which is meant to convey the statement: “Patient referred to physical therapy for low back pain.”  Coming up with this translation is tough for laypeople and compu…",
