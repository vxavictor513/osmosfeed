Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run.

Yet the capacity for a computer to reconstruct the shape of an object in 3D given only a few images has remained a difficult algorithmic problem for years. This fundamental computer vision task has applications ranging from the creation of e-commerce 3D models to autonomous vehicle navigation. \n\n\n\nA key part of the problem is how to determine the exact positions from which images were taken, known as pose inference.

First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., \"Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier”) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., \"Skier skis down the mountain\").
