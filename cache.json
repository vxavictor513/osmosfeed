Part of the plan is to explore some Javascript libraries that play well in the traditional server-side-rendered world of Spring web applications. Those libraries tend to have a light touch for the application developer, in the sense that they allow you to completely avoid Javascript, but still have nice a progressive \"modern\" UI. We also look at some more \"pure\" Javascript tools and frameworks. It’s kind of a spectrum, so as a TL;DR here is a list of the sample apps, in rough order of low to high Javascript content:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nhtmx: HTMX is a library that allows you to access modern browser features directly from HTML, rather than using…",

Could we then have detected SUNBURST in the initial hours or days by finding its C2 beacon?\nThe potential for beaconing detection is that it can serve as an early warning system and help discover novel persistence mechanisms in the initial hours or days after execution.

With another full year of lessons learned from the pandemic, public sector leaders will apply these insights in the way they execute their documented data strategies. \nSynthesizing what we see and hear from our stakeholders, below are five of the needle movers we see in public sector data strategy execution.

In this blog, brought to you by Elastic’s Engineering Security Team, we lean into this recent advancement to show how we are protecting the world’s data from attack.\nRecent events such as the exploitation of the Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) agent through CVE-2021-38647, which is installed by many Azure Linux machines, represents how quickly adversaries are moving from a publicly released proof-of-concept (POC) to exploitation. Another similar case with a recent VMware vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2021-22005) showed the same pattern where within hours of the security disclosure, malicious actors started mass scanning infrastructure target…",

A commonality between these strategies is the need for improved role-based data sharing and data re-use. The sticking point, however, is in the way to implement data sharing when there are known silos across and within various departments. More often than not, these silos exist for good reason, particularly for data privacy compliance requirements.\nHow can these hurdles be overcome and the promise of data sharing across government departments be realized?        \nKey stakeholders of government data sharing initiatives\nBefore tackling this dilemma, it’s important to understand the key stakeholders of government d…",

With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. \nHowever, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements.

Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we'll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before.

Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  \n However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model.

However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  \n An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …",

          "description": "Consider the windows on a car. First, they were manually clipped into place. And then they were hand-rolled into position. But that was too difficult. So the electric window was born. But holding your finger on the button for 10 seconds was onerous, so now, it’s automatic. It’s easy to see the trend toward convenience […]",

CB radio took off because human beings desperately want to connect with people they know and be heard by people they don’t. And then it went away because […]",

When we’re in flow, time slows down, satisfaction rises and we feel fully engaged. An easy way to end a flow state is to see how well you’re doing. Are you ahead […]",
