          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

In contrast to that, upgrading to a new minor or even a new major version requires more work, including code changes to adapt to new or changed APIs, updating configurations to not use deprecated keys anymore, and more.\n\r\nEach new minor or major version of Spring therefore ships with a comprehensive guide and documentation about those changes and you can read and follow to upgrade your project.

This year promises to be more amazing than ever, and I can’t wait to be a part of it.\n\r\nAs usual, the first week of January is when we mark the date of the first installment of this humble roundup, This Week in Spring, waaaay back in the first week of January 2011! 12 years of This Week in Spring! Now that’s consistency! \n\r\nAnd it’s only possible because of you, dear community. Thank you. You, who have been consistently excellent every week of the year for years and years, are truly the reason for the season, and we appreciate you. This week is no exception! There’s a ton of great content, so let’s kick the year off right!\n\r\n\r\n  \nFirst, I’ll be speaking at the Atlanta JUG on the 16th of this month, by the by, so please join me, and we’ll dive headfirst into Spring in 2023!\n\r\n  \nLast week, I had the pleasure of interviewing my friend, and teammate, the legendary DaShaun Carter on a Bootiful Podcast\n\r\n  \nI love this post by Rafael Winterhalter (create of ByteBuddy and Bootiful Podcast guest on the amazing publish/subscribe capabilities of PostgreSQL. I love PostgreSQL. But then he goes even further, turning the mechanism into support in Spring Integration. He explains everything in this epic post, Using Postgres as a Message Queue\n\r\n  \nCreate a new Git branch with no history - not strictly speaking Spring-related, but I thought it was interesting. Unless you’re not using Git… I suppose.\n\r\n  \nNonUniqueResultException in Spring Data JPA\n\r\n  \nObservability with Spring Boot 3\n\r\n  \nOddity with shutdown methods in Spring Boot 3 AOT and GraalVM\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot (3) Spring Native (GraalVM) with Kubernetes & Istio🔥\n\r\n  \nUsing Watermarks with iText in Java\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes 1.26: Job Tracking, to Support Massively Parallel Batch Workloads, Is Generally Available\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes v1.26: Advancements in Kubernetes Traffic Engineering\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes v1.26: Alpha support for cross-namespace storage data sources",

I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going? My family and I had a lovely Chris…",

For example, a website or a web service gets HTTP requests and sends back responses in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.). For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.\nThe structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.\nThere are a few considerations to make such an application work wel…",

These technological advances require that we are thoughtful and intentional in how they are developed and deployed. In this blogpost, we share ways we have approached Responsible AI across our research in the past year and where we’re headed in 2023. We highlight four primary themes covering foundational and socio-technical research, applied research, and product solutions, as part of our commitment to build AI products in a responsible and ethical manner, in alignment with our AI Principles.  \n    \n  \n · Theme 1: Responsible AI Research Advancement…",
