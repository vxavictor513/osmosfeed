In our understanding, it is \"how well you can understand the internals of your system by examining its outputs\". We believe that the interconnection between metrics, logging, and distributed tracing gives you the ability to reason about the state of your system in order to debug exceptions and latency in your applications. You can watch more about what we think observability is in this episode of Enlightning with Jonatan Ivanov.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe upcoming Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 release will contain numerous autoconfigurations fo…",

We are expecting a further release candidate in time for the first Spring Boot 3.0 release candidate next week, and then our final releases for general availability in November.\n\r\nAs a major revision of the core framework, 6.0 RC1 comes with a Java 17+ baseline, a move to Jakarta EE 9+ (in the jakarta namespace superseding the former javax based EE APIs), and a broader infrastructure revision. This provides access to the latest web containers such as Tomcat 10 / Jetty 11 and the latest persistence providers such as Hibernate ORM 6.1 - all of which are exclusively available with the jakarta-namespaced variants of the Servlet API and JPA.

Last year, we dived into the biggest projects and the most popular app patterns built with Spring, and a whole lot more! You told us your views about Spring Native, Data, and what matters to you when you start using a new Spring project.\n\r\nThe survey is back for 2022, and we’re really excited to learn again from you. What matters to you when you build with Spring? What types of apps are you building with Spring? What can we change, and what should remain the same?\n\r\nCompleting the survey should take about 15 minutes. If you want to be among the first to get the report, feel free to leave your email at the end of the survey.\n\r\nOk, if you’re ready, head over to spring.io/survey now!\n\r\nOne last thing - we’d really appreciate it if you share the survey with others in the Spring community.

This means it’s syntactically closer to code than human-readable sentences.

The technique is often used for temporal up-sampling to increase the refresh rate of videos or to create slow motion effects.

Interpolating between these “near-duplicate” photos can lead to engaging videos that reveal scene motion, often delivering an even more pleasing sense of the moment than the original photos.  \n  \nFrame interpolation between consecutive video frames, which often have small motion, has been studied extensively.
