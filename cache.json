          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. \n\r\nAnd, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press! \n\r\n\r\n  \nBootiful Podcast: Spring Framework contributor Sébastien Deleuze on GraalVM, AOT, project Leyden, and WebAssembly\n\r\n  \nCVE report published for Spring Cloud Function\n\r\n  \nDebugging Collections, Streams and Watch Renderers\n\r\n  \nDifference Between Flux.create and Flux.generate\n\r\n  \nHandle Spring Security Exceptions With @ExceptionHandler\n\r\n  \nMongoDB Composite Key With Spring Data\n\r\n  \nSpring Authorization Server 0.3.1 available now\n\r\n  \nMonitoring Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot Admin\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.2.1 and 2021.1.5 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data JPA – Run an App Without a Database\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB SpEL Expression Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22980)\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.21 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.2 and 5.6.6 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.0 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.1 released\n\r\n  \nWhat are the Spring Boot Default Memory Settings?\n\r\n  \nA Guide to Docker Private Registry\n\r\n  \nIs There a Destructor in Java?",

It provides an in-depth look at all things Spring for GraphQL.\n\r\nThis week I’m publishing two new installments. \n\r\nIn this week’s first installment, episode three of a series, looks at batching requests with Spring for GraphQL’s @BatchMapping support. This mechanism in turn builds on Facebook’s DataLoader facility. \n\r\n\r\nThen, in this week’s second installment, episode four of a series, we look at how to make a change with mutations. This is one of my favorite parts about GraphQL - it’s plain, pragmatic, and - most importantly - obvious! \n\r\n\r\nThis continues the series we started last week, with episodes one and two, which I recap here: \n\r\nIn this first installment, we look at the basics of using the GraphQL Java engine that underpins Spring for GraphQL. \n\r\n\r\nIn this second installment, we look at using the Spring for GraphQL component model by writing queries. \n\r\n\r\nI know it’s been more than a month since we last published a video, so I’m going to be releasing every episode of this series very quickly, over the next week or two. I’ve already recorded and mostly finished producing eight episodes. I’m working on producing a ninth, and that’ll be that! A complete introduction to all things Spring for GraphQL. These are of course part of the usual Spring Tips playlist on YouTube, but also part of the Learn Spring for GraphQL with Josh Long playlist. Follow that one to be notified of any new episodes!",

Whenever a quantum system is measured, the act of this measurement destroys the “quantumness” of the state. For example, if the quantum state is in a superposition of two locations, where it can seem to be in two places at the same time, once it is measured, it will randomly appear either ”here” or “there”, but not both. We only ever see the classical shadows cast by this strange quantum world. \nA growing number of experiments are implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms to aid in analyzing data, but these have the same limitations as the people they a…",

Trees in cities, called urban forests, provide critical benefits for public health and wellbeing and will prove integral to urban climate adaptation. They filter air and water, capture stormwater runoff, sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, and limit erosion and drought. Shade from urban trees reduces energy-expensive cooling costs and mitigates urban heat islands. In the US alone, urban fo…",

          "description": "Posted by Laura Downs and Anthony Francis, Software Engineers, Robotics at Google  \nMany recent advances in computer vision and robotics rely on deep learning, but training deep learning models requires a wide variety of data to generalize to new scenarios. Historically, deep learning for computer vision has relied on datasets with millions of items that were gathered by web scraping, examples of which include ImageNet, Open Images, YouTube-8M, and COCO. However, the process of creating these datasets can be labor-intensive, and can still exhibit labeling errors that can distort the perception of progress. Furthermore, this strategy does not readily generalize to arbitrary three-dimensional shapes or real-world robotic data.  \n \n\nReal-world robotic data collection is very useful, but diffi…",

Instead of every part of a model processing every input (“dense” modeling), sparse models employing conditional computation learn to route individual inputs to different “experts” in a potentially huge network. This has many benefits. First, model size can increase while keeping computational cost constant — an effective and environmentally friendlier way to scale models, which is often key to high performance. Sparsity also naturally compartmentalizes neural networks. Dense models that learn many different tasks simultaneously (multitask) or sequentially (continual learning) of…",

DP has been the basis of several practical deployments in industry — and has even been employed by the U.S. Census — because it enables the understanding of system and algorithm privacy guarantees. The underlying assumption of DP is that changing a single user’s contribution to an algorithm should not significantly change its output distribution. \n In the standard supervised learning setting, a model is trained to make a prediction of the label for each input given a training set of example pairs {[input1,label1], …, [inputn, labeln]}.
