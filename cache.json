These events can originate from a variety of sources, such as from an HTTP endpoint, messages on a queue or topic, or from public cloud resources. Kubernetes has become synonymous with managing infrastructure and applications in cloud native architectures and many organizations are reliant on these systems for running their business critical workloads.

As such, it’s essential to protect against this sort of information leakage. \n\nDifferential privacy (DP) provides formal protection against an attacker who aims to extract information about the training data.

It was previously unknown that external eye photos contained signals for these conditions. This exciting finding suggested the potential to reduce the need for specialized equipment since such photos can be captured using smartphones and other consumer devices.

Understanding the content of videos, however, is a challenging task as videos often contain multiple events occurring at different time scales.
