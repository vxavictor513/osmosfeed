          "description": "Yesterday we announced a Spring Framework RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, listing Apache Tomcat as one of several preconditions. The Apache Tomcat team has since released versions 10.0.20, 9.0.62, and 8.5.78 all of which close the attack vector on Tomcat’s side. While the vulnerability is not in Tomcat itself, in real world situations, it is important to be able to choose among multiple upgrade paths that in turn provides flexibility and layered protection. \n\r\nUpgrading to Spring Framework 5.3.18+ or 5.2.20+ continues to be our main recommendation not only because it addresses the root cause and prevents other possible attack vectors, but also because it adds protection for other CVEs addressed since the current version in use. \n\r\nFor older, unsupported versions of the Spring Framework, the Tomcat releases provide an adequate solution for the reported attack vector. Nevertheless, we must stress that this should only be seen as a tactical solution, while the main goal should still be to upgrade to a currently supported Spring Framework version as soon as possible.\n\r\nLast but not least, it’s worth mentioning that downgrading to Java 8 provides another viable workaround, which may be another tactical solution option.",

A long word, you may be wondering what it really means and how you can add it to your skillset. Here’s a quick primer to get you going on your path to observability.\nWhere did the term “observability” come from?\nThe concept of observability dates back to the mid-20th century, where it was originally used in control theory to describe how the internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of the system’s external outputs. Rudolf E. Kalman, a Hungarian-American electrical engineer and mathematician, coined the term in the 1960s in several seminal papers around dynamical and observable systems. \nWhile the term is still used in the math…",

In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. \nDespite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks.
