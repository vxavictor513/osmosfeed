          "description": "I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.\n\r\nSpring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.\n\r\nGiven that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.\n\r\nThis first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.\n\r\nIn the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow",

          "description": ",\nIt’s time to re-evaluate how we define the term “search.” Today, search has far broader applications than those of a standard search engine query. That’s especially true when it comes to cybersecurity. \n\nIn fact, in a recent survey of 832 data leaders, cybersecurity was named as the top business priority that organizations use search-powered technology for today. The survey, conducted by Forrester Consulting and commissioned by Elastic, defines search-powered technology as tools that enable the search of data across multiple sources, such as websites, applications, databases, and hybrid cloud environments. \n\nSearch capabilities can assist security analysts in detection and response processes such as:\n\nFacilitating real-time detection and protection from endpoints to data centers\nEnabling…",

          "description": ",\nUnderstanding AIOps for observability \nArtificial Intelligence for IT Operations (or AIOps for short) continues to be a hot topic among developers, SREs, and DevOps professionals. The case for AIOps is especially crucial given the expansive nature of today’s observability efforts across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. As with most observability platforms, it all starts with your telemetry data: metrics, logs, traces, and events. \n\nOnce IT operations teams collect and begin analyzing that data, the benefit of AIOps becomes rapidly clear. AIOps aims to accurately and proactively identify areas that need attention and assist IT teams in solving issues faster. As human beings, we cannot keep up with analyzing petabytes of raw observability data. Adding AIOps delivers a layer of intellig…",

They are not just focusing on the modeling language as such but have workflow systems in mind too. It’s valuable to have a closer look at those patterns and discuss which parts of it can be shown and even automated in BPMN, and which parts are taken care of in the technical implementation. I have seen BPMN diagrams that try to include every aspect in the diagram itself. This often leads to overloaded BPMN models with a lack of clear transparency of the business flow.

This has received increased attention [1, 2, 3] since the introduction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The problem is challenging because to accurately synthesize new views of a scene, a model needs to capture many types of information — its detailed 3D structure, materials, and illumination —  from a small set of reference images.  \nIn this post, we present recently published deep learning models for view synthesis.
