          "description": "I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.\n\r\nSpring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.\n\r\nGiven that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.\n\r\nThis first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.\n\r\nIn the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow",

Requirements To understand this blog post, it is useful to have a certain understanding of Kubernetes and Zeebe itself. Summer Hackdays: Hackdays are a regular event at Camunda, where people from different departments (engineering, consulting, DevRel, etc.) work together on new ideas, pet projects, and more.

According to a 2021 report from Postman, developers reported spending nearly half of their time working on APIs, and 94% of companies planned to increase their investments in APIs in 2022. API-first development is also gaining traction, with an impressive 67% of companies embracing this methodology. Companies like Twilio and Stripe emerged as early winners in this new economy, with the promise of many more to come.  APIs offer organizations an opportunity to tap into best-of-breed software components without having to spend precious time or development resources creating them from scratch. With that said, an often-overlooked aspect of the API economy is how...\nThe post Could Process Orchestration be the “Glue” for the API Economy? appeared first on Camunda.",

Its goal is to be easy to understand, and at the same time, be full-featured enough to handle decision tables and literal expressions. When business and IT often work together on complex projects, writing expressions in a (relatively) accessible way reduces miscommunications and helps align teams. Camunda uses FEEL to map and transform business process data dynamically. For example, a loan application process pulls a credit score from an API call into a decision table. The decision table automates the next step of the process depending on the rules in the table. The data from the decision automation can then be...\nThe post FEEL more confident transforming data appeared first on Camunda.",

They are not just focusing on the modeling language as such but have workflow systems in mind too. It’s valuable to have a closer look at those patterns and discuss which parts of it can be shown and even automated in BPMN, and which parts are taken care of in the technical implementation. I have seen BPMN diagrams that try to include every aspect in the diagram itself. This often leads to overloaded BPMN models with a lack of clear transparency of the business flow.

In these settings, even a single dataset may require terabytes or petabytes of data storage.

This has received increased attention [1, 2, 3] since the introduction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The problem is challenging because to accurately synthesize new views of a scene, a model needs to capture many types of information — its detailed 3D structure, materials, and illumination —  from a small set of reference images.  \nIn this post, we present recently published deep learning models for view synthesis.
