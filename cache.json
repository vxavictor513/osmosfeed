The increased use of digital wallets, real-time payments, embedded payments (such as ApplePay and GooglePay), peer to peer payment systems, and other emerging vehicles ramped up. In fact, according to statista.com, digital payments are projected to reach $11.55 trillion in transaction value within 2024 — all while cash as a form of payment continues to decrease globally.\nWhile this revolution has greatly improved efficiency and reduced friction for customers, banks, and merchants, it has also resulted in an exponential growth in fraud in financial serv…",

          "description": "When investing in technology, organizations should look for products and services that get them the best bang for their buck. So, who comes out on top when investing in search and logging solutions? Elasticsearch® surpasses OpenSearch in cost efficiency.\n\nHow? OpenSearch is a forked search project based on old versions (7.10) of Elasticsearch and Kibana®. Through comprehensive tests, TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group validated that Elasticsearch outperforms OpenSearch across key performance indicators and resource utilization. Based on this technical validation, Elastic® developed a complementary report to provide a framework for buyers to understand the financial value their organization can reap when migrating from Opensearch to Elasticsearch for search and logging.\n\nWhether it is improving resource optimization, faster performance, IT efficiency, or license cost savings, the Elasticsearch Service Enterprise license tier has much more to offer than the OpenSearch Service.\nThe release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

DP offers a robust solution to address growing concerns about data protection, enabling technologies across industries and government applications (e.g., the US census) without compromising individual user identities.  As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations.
