Although a response is not returned for a request sent in this way, it does reach the corresponding server-side endpoint.\n\r\nThe practice of using a type-level @RequestMapping on a Feign client interface has been discouraged in the documentation, but we’re now taking the step to reject it completely.\n\r\nThese versions will be picked up later by the 2020.0.x and 2021.0.x release trains, however, we recommend you already upgrade Spring Cloud OpenFeign in your projects to these most recent versions.\n\r\nSee all issues included in 2.2.10.RELEASE here\nSee all issues included in 3.1.0-M4 here\nNo additional issues were included for 3.0.5.",

Even on well-designed, well-organized websites, visitors frequently resort to search to find the exact products, services, content, and information they need. In fact, many visitors go immediately to the search box. The quality of search results they get back, and the ease with which they can customize and filter those results, can play an outsized role in engagement, conversion, and customer loyalty. \n\nWhy “good enough” search usually isn’t good enough\nIt’s just a search box, right? How important could it really be? Turns out, pretty important.\nAccording to a recent study, nearly a third of website visitors start with search.

The application of deep learning models to weather forecasts can be relevant to people on a day-to-day basis, from helping people plan their day to managing food production, transportation systems, or the energy grid. Weather forecasts typically rely on traditional physics-based techniques powered by the world’s largest supercomputers. Such methods are constrained by high computational requirements and are sensitive to approximations of the physical laws on which they are based.  \n Deep learning offers a new approach to computing forecasts. Rather than incorporating explicit physical law…",

          "description": "Posted by Artem Dementyev, Hardware Engineer, Google Research \nMost wearable smart devices and mobile phones have the means to communicate with the user through tactile feedback, enabling applications from simple notifications to sensory substitution for accessibility. Typically, they accomplish this using vibrotactile actuators, which are small electric vibration motors. However, designing a haptic system that is well-targeted and effective for a given task requires experimentation with the number of actuators and their locations in the device, yet most practical applications require standalone on-body devices and integration into small form factors. This combination of factors can be difficult to address outside of a laboratory as integrating these systems can be quite time-consuming and…",

Making reasonable predictions about the future at varying timescales is one of the most important capabilities for such agents because it enables them to predict changes in the world around them, including other agents’ behaviors, and plan how to act next. Importantly, successful future prediction requires both capturing meaningful transitions in the environment (e.g., dough transforming into bread) and adapting to how transitions unfold over time in order to make decisions.  \n  \nPrevious work in future prediction from visual observations has largely been const…",

Movshovitz-Attias), Software Engineer, Google Research    \nWhen building a deep model for a new machine learning application, researchers often begin with existing network architectures, such as ResNets or EfficientNets. If the initial model’s accuracy isn’t high enough, a larger model may be a tempting alternative, but may not actually be the best solution for the task at hand. Instead, better performance potentially could be achieved by designing a new model that is optimized for the task.

The challenge is that the reactor must create a plasma at a temperature of tens of millions of degrees, which requires a highly complex, finely tuned system to confine and sustain. Further, creating the plasma and maintaining it, requires substantial amounts of energy, which, to date, have exceeded that released in the fusion reaction itself.

While RL excels at discovering how to solve tasks from scratch, it can struggle in training an agent to understand the reversibility of its actions, which can be crucial to ensure that agents behave in a safe manner within their environment. For instance, robots are generally costly and require maintenance, so one wants to avoid taking actions that might lead to broken components. Estimating if an action is reversible or not (or better, how easily it can be reversed) requires a working knowledge of the physics of the environment in which the agent is operating.
