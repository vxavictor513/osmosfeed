In contrast to that, upgrading to a new minor or even a new major version requires more work, including code changes to adapt to new or changed APIs, updating configurations to not use deprecated keys anymore, and more.\n\r\nEach new minor or major version of Spring therefore ships with a comprehensive guide and documentation about those changes and you can read and follow to upgrade your project.

I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going? My family and I had a lovely Chris…",

The release adds the following features:\n\r\n\r\n  \nWe introduced @ApplicationModuleListener to ease the declaration of asynchronous, transactional event listeners that run in a transaction themselves. A model that we recommend as default to integration application modules. (#80, reference documentation)\n\r\n  \nThe application module dependency structure is now also exposed as Spring Boot actuator. This allows operating infrastructure to visualize insights it provides to operations teams to be aligned with the application module structure (HTTP traces by module etc.) (#87, reference documentation\n\r\n  \nThe Postgres event publication registry schema now follows Postgres best practices. (#81)\n\r\n\r\nThe release also contains the obligatory upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0.1. Find more information on the release page.",

These details allow looking behind the curtains of the anomaly scoring algorithm.\nWe have written about anomaly scoring and normalization in this blog before.

For example, a website or a web service gets HTTP requests and sends back responses in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.). For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.\nThe structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.\nThere are a few considerations to make such an application work wel…",

          "description": ",\nDo you know the difference between remote work and distributed teams?\n\nPost-pandemic, a large majority of the global workforce works remotely in one way or another. In fact, an Owl Labs study found that 62% of workers aged 22 to 65 claimed to work remotely at least occasionally.\n\nWhat you might not know is that experience working remotely doesn’t necessarily translate to working in a fully distributed environment. \n\nThe difference between remote work and distributed work starts at the company level. Companies that are distributed have an ethos that where you do your work doesn’t impact your performance. Working remotely is at the individual level. It is someone choosing, or being allowed, to work a certain way some, or all, of the time. It can be a hard distinction to make, but at Elasti…",

While unstructured data can be incredibly useful when combined with full text search functionality, there are cases where we need a little more structure to use the data to answer our questions.\nSchema on write or schema on read — why not both?\nSchema on write remains the default option that Elasticsearch uses to handle incoming data.
