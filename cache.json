          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! This week’s all sorts of weird for me. It’s Tuesday! But here in the US we just celebrated the 4th of July, and I, like many Americans, took a long weekend. Took some time with the family to do a little road trip up north to visit Mt. Shasta, Crater Lake, Lassen National Park, etc. It was a ton of fun, and a lot of driving! Anyway, it all kinda blurs together and felt like just one weekend, and today feels like Monday. I only just realized it was Tuesday! And you know what that means? It’s time for our weekly dive into the wild and wonderful world of Springdom! \n\r\n\r\n  \nThe last of my eight part series on building GraphQL applications with Spring for GraphQL is up! Check that page out and find links to all eight videos, each of which introduces one interesting dimension of the powerful and novel new Spring for GraphQL project.\n\r\n  \nIn last week’s installment of A Bootiful Podcast, I talk to Spring Developer Advocate Dan Vega\n\r\n  \nProcessing the Response Body in Spring Cloud Gateway\n\r\n  \nSpring Cloud 2020.0.6 is available\n\r\n  \nUUID as Entity ID in MongoDB\n\r\n  \nI liked this post over on Dzone: Are All Kubernetes Ingresses the Same?\n\r\n  \nWant to learn more about how to build GraalVM native images for Spring Boot 2.x-generation applications? Check out this article I wrote for InfoQ on Spring Native and GraalVM\n\r\n  \nThe good folks over at Vaadin have put together a nice tutorial on building full-stack Spring Boot applications using their Java web framework called Hilla - check it out!\n\r\n  \nour friends over at Sivalabs have put together an interesting looking tutorial on how to use Spring Boot and Kubernetes together\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot team member Stéphane Nicoll did a French-language presentation for DevFest Lille recently introducing Spring AOT",

Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. \n\r\nAnd, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press! \n\r\n\r\n  \nBootiful Podcast: Spring Framework contributor Sébastien Deleuze on GraalVM, AOT, project Leyden, and WebAssembly\n\r\n  \nCVE report published for Spring Cloud Function\n\r\n  \nDebugging Collections, Streams and Watch Renderers\n\r\n  \nDifference Between Flux.create and Flux.generate\n\r\n  \nHandle Spring Security Exceptions With @ExceptionHandler\n\r\n  \nMongoDB Composite Key With Spring Data\n\r\n  \nSpring Authorization Server 0.3.1 available now\n\r\n  \nMonitoring Spring Boot applications using Spring Boot Admin\n\r\n  \nSpring Data 2021.2.1 and 2021.1.5 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Data JPA – Run an App Without a Database\n\r\n  \nSpring Data MongoDB SpEL Expression Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2022-22980)\n\r\n  \nSpring Framework 5.3.21 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Security 5.7.2 and 5.6.6 available now\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.0 released\n\r\n  \nSpring Tools 4.15.1 released\n\r\n  \nWhat are the Spring Boot Default Memory Settings?\n\r\n  \nA Guide to Docker Private Registry\n\r\n  \nIs There a Destructor in Java?",

          "description": "Elasticsearch is a very versatile platform that supports a variety of use cases and provides great flexibility around data organisation and replication strategies. This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.\nWhen we come across users that are experiencing performance problems, it is not uncommon that this can be traced back to issue…",

Better code optimization can significantly reduce the operational cost of large datacenter applications.

For example, if the quantum state is in a superposition of two locations, where it can seem to be in two places at the same time, once it is measured, it will randomly appear either ”here” or “there”, but not both.

          "description": "Posted by Basil Mustafa, Research Software Engineer and Carlos Riquelme, Research Scientist, Google Research, Brain team \nSparse models stand out among the most promising approaches for the future of deep learning. Instead of every part of a model processing every input (“dense” modeling), sparse models employing conditional computation learn to route individual inputs to different “experts” in a potentially huge network. This has many benefits. First, model size can increase while keeping computational cost constant — an effective and environmentally friendlier way to scale models, which is often key to high performance. Sparsity also naturally compartmentalizes neural networks. Dense models that learn many different tasks simultaneously (multitask) or sequentially (continual learning) of…",
