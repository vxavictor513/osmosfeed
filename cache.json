Now, this is not particularly noteworthy for those millions who already live here. But I don’t live here. I’m a visitor! I live in San Francisco. I had to fly here! On a plane! With other people! ACROSS THE OCEAN. This is my first international flight since March of 2020, and I couldn’t be more excited to be here for Devoxx UK and also just to catch up with old friends I haven’t seen in nearly three years. If you know me, and how I used to travel, you’ll appreciate how odd it is for me to be this excited to have crossed a border. It’s been sooo long! I’ve missed the process. I’ve missed seeing people. I’ve missed all of it. \n\r\nOne thing I haven’t missed is a lot of this week’s new and noteworthy, which I recap in this week’s This Week in Spring roundup. Let’s goooo! \n\r\n\r\n  \nA Bootiful Podcast: Java Champion and Spring Katas legend Chandra Guntur\n\r\n  \nApr 28 - What’s New in Spring Cloud Gateway Commercial?\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes 1.24: Volume Expansion Now A Stable Feature\n\r\n  \nBlog: Storage Capacity Tracking reaches GA in Kubernetes 1.24\n\r\n  \nBuild a Goodreads Clone with Spring Boot and Astra DB — Part 1\n\r\n  \nHow to enable mutual TLS in a Spring Boot Application | by Salar Ahmadi | Mar, 2022 | Medium\n\r\n  \nSchedule a task in Spring Boot.

NLP opens up opportunities to extract information, classify text, and provide better search relevance through dense vectors and approximate nearest neighbor search.\nIn this multi-part blog series, we will walk through end-to-end examples using a variety of PyTorch NLP models.\nPart 1: How to deploy text embeddings and vector search\nPart 2: Named entity recognition (NER)\nPart 3: Sentiment analysis\nIn each example we will use a prebuilt NLP model from the Hugging Face model hub. Then we will follow the Elastic documented instructions for deploying an NLP model and adding NLP inference to an ingest pipeline.  Because it’s always a good idea to start with a defined use case and an understanding of the text data to process in the model, we’ll start by defining the objective for using NLP and a shared data set for anyone to try out.\nTo prepare for the NLP example, we will need an Elasticsearch cluster running at least version 8.0, an ML node with at least 2GB RAM, and for the named entity recognition (NER) example we’ll use the required mapper-annotated-text plugin. One of the easiest ways to get started is by following along with these NLP examples with your own free 14-day trial cluster on Elastic Cloud. Cloud trials are able to scale to a max of two 2GB ML nodes, which will allow you to deploy one or two of examples at any one time in this multi-part blog series.",

This payload has been observed across systems for five years, suggesting that the threat actors responsible for operating the malware have been around for some time and have likely operated undetected in many environments. \nThe threat actors have leveraged a network of VPS servers to act as a controller and access these systems via compromised routers based out of Taiwan, acting as a VPN network for the adversarial group. In the Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team’s deep research, we explore the actual payload, the backdoor lifecycle, and the BPF filters that are leveraged to provide you with insights on how evasion occurs within impacted systems. \nIt’s important to know how you can detect this payload threat and understand the sophistication of the loader.

In large part, this has been accomplished through pre-training language models on extensive unlabeled text corpora.  \nThis pre-training formulation does not make assumptions about input signal modality, which can be language, vision, or audio, among others.

For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him. Or if someone mentions “python” in a sentence, one can use the context from the conversation to determine whether they are referring to a type of snake or a computer language.

The radio transceivers that communicate with our mobile phones, the equipment that supports them (such as power and wired networking), and the physical space they occupy are all expensive, so it’s important to be judicious in choosing sites for new transceivers.

Performance on research benchmarks like WMT have soared, and translation services have improved in quality and expanded to include new languages. Nevertheless, while existing translation services cover languages spoken by the majority of people world wide, they only include around 100 languages in total, just over 1% of those actively spoken globally. Moreover, the languages that are currently represented are overwhelmingly European, largely overlooking regions of high linguistic diversity, like Africa and the Americas. \n There are two key bottlenecks t…",

However, effectively training an RL policy requires exploring a large set of robot states and actions, including many that are not safe for the robot. This is a considerable risk, for example, when training a legged robot. Because such robots are inherently unstable, there is a high likelihood of the robot falling during learning, which could cause damage. \nThe risk of damage can be mitigated to some extent by learning the control policy in computer simulation and then deploying it in the real world.
