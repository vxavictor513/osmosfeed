          "description": "As technology evolution continues at its rapid pace, so does observability. Observability is becoming critical to driving positive business outcomes, and we wanted to understand how users are evaluating trends and their impact over the coming years. And while every organization approaches observability around its own unique needs, there are usually specific trends and shifts that the broader industry undergoes. \n\nElastic® recently surveyed over 500 observability decision-makers around key topics in modern observability. Respondents were asked about the progress and benefits they are seeing in their observability initiatives, and the impact of generative AI and OpenTelemetry on observability. The survey, completed with Dimensional Research in January 2024, delivered some surprising results …",

In fact, you’d struggle to find tech companies that have not announced AI integrations into their tech stack in one way or another. Cynics might say this is a passing phase, but the reason AI is so popular is that it’s a versatile set of capabilities that can help solve a lot of problems.\nThe most direct way AI can be utilized is in the form of a chatbot: a conversational interface that mimics human interaction, generating contextual responses based on what the user inputs. Sometimes these are text-based, such as the customer service bots you often see on websites or apps. And sometimes they’re voice-enabled, like Siri, Google Assistant, and Alexa.

But anyone who remembers the days of Alta Vista should understand how well we have it now.\nWhen I say “search engine,” it’s easy to picture popular web search engines like Google and — to a lesser extent — Bing.

It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a\nprocess, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the\nkernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a\nnode to your Pods and containers.\nBut distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,\nbecause the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can\npossibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles\nOperator solve that problem by\nrunning as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that\ndistribution could be done by the container\nruntime.\nRuntimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:\na…",
