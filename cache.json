Whenever we’re looking for something, we throw a word or phrase into a search engine and, like magic, it gives us a list of matching results. It might not feel as magical nowadays because it’s something we do every day. But anyone who remembers the days of Alta Vista should understand how well we have it now.\nWhen I say “search engine,” it’s easy to picture popular web search engines like Google and — to a lesser extent — Bing. But the application of search engines goes far beyond just searching the web.

So, who comes out on top when investing in search and logging solutions? Elasticsearch® surpasses OpenSearch in cost efficiency.\n\nHow? OpenSearch is a forked search project based on old versions (7.10) of Elasticsearch and Kibana®. Through comprehensive tests, TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group validated that Elasticsearch outperforms OpenSearch across key performance indicators and resource utilization. Based on this technical validation, Elastic® developed a complementary report to provide a framework for buyers to understand the financial value their organization can reap when migrating from Opensearch to Elasticsearch for search and logging.\n\nWhether it is improving resource optimization, faster performance, IT efficiency, or license cost savings, the Elasticsearch Service Enterprise license tier has much more to offer than the OpenSearch Service.\nThe release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

How does this whole process of integration\nof Kubernetes to various cloud providers happen? To answer that, let's put the spotlight on SIG\nCloud Provider.\nSIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud\nproviders. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear\nstandards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes.

Often, models are trained on longitudinal data with the hope that the training data used will accurately represent inputs the model may receive in the future. More generally, the default assumption that all training data are equally relevant often breaks in practice. For example, the figure below shows images from the CLEAR nonstationary learning benchmark, and it illustrates how visual features of objects evolve significantly over a 10 year span (a phenomenon we refer to as slow concept drift), posing a challenge for object categorization models. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSample ima…",

DP offers a robust solution to address growing concerns about data protection, enabling technologies across industries and government applications (e.g., the US census) without compromising individual user identities.  As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations. Researchers have recently found errors in the mathematical proofs of private mechanisms, and their implementations.
