How can Spring help you build new apps and experiences this year? What would you like us to change? This year, we have new sections on Spring Native, building & sharing APIs internally/externally, and a deeper dive on Data.\n\r\nIn exchange for 15 minutes of your time taking the survey, you’ll be among the first to receive our report and the insights included in it. \n\r\nSounds good? Head over to spring.io/survey now!

The project integrates GraphQL Java and Spring and was developed in collaboration between both teams.\n\r\nToday is GraphQL Java’s 6th birthday! One fundamental decision I made from the start was to leave any HTTP and IO aspects as a separate concern. GraphQL Java has always been “just” an engine to execute GraphQL requests. The decision has paid off but the obvious downside is the need to create your own HTTP adapter for real world usage.\n\r\nThis lead to the creation of a multitude of GraphQL integrations for Spring over the years, including the GraphQL Java Spring project from the GraphQL Java team.\n\r\nBut…",
