          "description": "MongoDB’s flexible schema allows for multiple patterns when it comes to modeling relationships between entities. Also, for many use cases, a denormalized data model (storing related data right within a single document) might be the best choice, because all information is kept in one place, so that the application requires fewer queries to fetch all data. However, this approach also has its downsides, such as potential data duplication, larger documents, and the maximum document size.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn general, MongoDB recommends using normalized data models when the advantages of embedding are neglected by the implications of duplication.

Through this feature, selections are automatically expanded, and for selections with defined classification types, e.g., addresses and phone numbers, users are offered an app with which to open the selection, saving users even more time. \n\n  Today we describe how we have improved the performance of Smart Text Selection by using federated learning to train the neural network model on user interactions responsibly while preserving user p…",

Consider a task in which a robot tries to slide a block across a table to precisely position it into a slot. There are many possible ways to solve this task, each requiring precise movements and corrections. The robot must commit to just one of these options, but must also be capable of changing plans each time the block ends up sliding farther than expected. Although one might expect such a task to be easy, that is often not the case for modern learning-based robots, which often le…",

The challenge is that the reactor must create a plasma at a temperature of tens of millions of degrees, which requires a highly complex, finely tuned system to confine and sustain. Further, creating the plasma and maintaining it, requires substantial amounts of energy, which, to date, have exceeded that released in the fusion reaction itself.

While RL excels at discovering how to solve tasks from scratch, it can struggle in training an agent to understand the reversibility of its actions, which can be crucial to ensure that agents behave in a safe manner within their environment. For instance, robots are generally costly and require maintenance, so one wants to avoid taking actions that might lead to broken components. Estimating if an action is reversible or not (or better, how easily it can be reversed) requires a working knowledge of the physics of the environment in which the agent is operating.
