Now, this is not particularly noteworthy for those millions who already live here. But I don’t live here. I’m a visitor! I live in San Francisco. I had to fly here! On a plane! With other people! ACROSS THE OCEAN. This is my first international flight since March of 2020, and I couldn’t be more excited to be here for Devoxx UK and also just to catch up with old friends I haven’t seen in nearly three years. If you know me, and how I used to travel, you’ll appreciate how odd it is for me to be this excited to have crossed a border. It’s been sooo long! I’ve missed the process. I’ve missed seeing people. I’ve missed all of it. \n\r\nOne thing I haven’t missed is a lot of this week’s new and noteworthy, which I recap in this week’s This Week in Spring roundup. Let’s goooo! \n\r\n\r\n  \nA Bootiful Podcast: Java Champion and Spring Katas legend Chandra Guntur\n\r\n  \nApr 28 - What’s New in Spring Cloud Gateway Commercial?\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes 1.24: Volume Expansion Now A Stable Feature\n\r\n  \nBlog: Storage Capacity Tracking reaches GA in Kubernetes 1.24\n\r\n  \nBuild a Goodreads Clone with Spring Boot and Astra DB — Part 1\n\r\n  \nHow to enable mutual TLS in a Spring Boot Application | by Salar Ahmadi | Mar, 2022 | Medium\n\r\n  \nSchedule a task in Spring Boot.

In this research piece, we explore BPFDoor — a backdoor payload specifically crafted for Linux in order to gain re-entry into a previously or actively compromised target environment. This payload has been observed across systems for five years, suggesting that the threat actors responsible for operating the malware have been around for some time and have likely operated undetected in many environments. \nThe threat actors have leveraged a network of VPS servers to act as a controller and access these systems via compromised routers based out of Taiwan, acting as a VPN network for the adversarial group. In the Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team’s deep research, we explore the actual payload, the backdoor lifecycle, and the BPF filters that are leveraged to provide you with insights on how evasion occurs within impacted systems. \nIt’s important to know how you can detect this payload threat and understand the sophistication of the loader. Both are covered in this research. The Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team also shares the actual indicators of compromise.\nIt’s critical to invest the time and resources into ensuring your organization’s workloads remain effectively monitored.

In large part, this has been accomplished through pre-training language models on extensive unlabeled text corpora.  \nThis pre-training formulation does not make assumptions about input signal modality, which can be language, vision, or audio, among others.

For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him. Or if someone mentions “python” in a sentence, one can use the context from the conversation to determine whether they are referring to a type of snake or a computer language. If a virtual assistant cannot robustly handle context and references, users would be required to adapt to the limitation of the technology by…",

The radio transceivers that communicate with our mobile phones, the equipment that supports them (such as power and wired networking), and the physical space they occupy are all expensive, so it’s important to be judicious in choosing sites for new transceivers.

Today’s language models at the scale of 100B or more parameters achieve strong performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation, even with little or no training examples. Even the largest language models, however, can still struggle with certain multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning. How might we enable language models to perform such reasoning tasks? \nIn “Chain of Thought Prompting Elicits Reasoning in Large Language Models,” we explore a prompting method for improving the re…",

However, effectively training an RL policy requires exploring a large set of robot states and actions, including many that are not safe for the robot. This is a considerable risk, for example, when training a legged robot. Because such robots are inherently unstable, there is a high likelihood of the robot falling during learning, which could cause damage. \nThe risk of damage can be mitigated to some extent by learning the control policy in computer simulation and then deploying it in the real world.
