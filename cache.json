          "description": "I am pleased to announce the availability of Spring Modulith 0.2. The release adds the following features:\n\r\n\r\n  \nWe introduced @ApplicationModuleListener to ease the declaration of asynchronous, transactional event listeners that run in a transaction themselves. A model that we recommend as default to integration application modules. (#80, reference documentation)\n\r\n  \nThe application module dependency structure is now also exposed as Spring Boot actuator. This allows operating infrastructure to visualize insights it provides to operations teams to be aligned with the application module structure (HTTP traces by module etc.) (#87, reference documentation\n\r\n  \nThe Postgres event publication registry schema now follows Postgres best practices. (#81)\n\r\n\r\nThe release also contains the obligatory upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0.1. Find more information on the release page.",

See my friends on the Spring team in person since the pandemic descended. And, I’m overjoyed to relate, I’ve just had the privilege of a nice meeting with several of them last night.

You never know when the next pandemic (or life in general) will put distance between you and them. So, in order to close that distance, I’m going to go back to meetings with them, and I’ll leave you with yet another week’s curated list of content.

This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.\nWhen we come across users that are experiencing performance problems, it is not uncommon that this can be traced back to issue…",

Ok, so what exactly is “linting?” Its fundamental objective is to promote proven behaviors, patterns, and practices while avoiding typical traps that can quickly result in errors or make code more difficult to maintain. That is - leverage community recommendations and opinions in writing Ansible content by means of a tool to help ensure what you’re writing is generally valid.",
