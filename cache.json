          "description": ",\nObservability is critical for effective security implementation. It allows organizations to monitor their systems, applications, and networks in real-time; detect and investigate security incidents; and quickly respond to them. But having multiple tools and solutions for observability can create a fragmented view of the environment, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security posture and respond to threats effectively.\nThis is where a unified observability solution becomes essential for organizations. It consolidates all data sources into a single platform, allowing security teams to view and correlate data from across the entire infrastructure. This provides a complete picture of the environment and enables security teams to quickly identify and respond to …",

To realize this potential, however, organizations need ML solutions to be reliable with ML solution development that is predictable and tractable. The key to both is a deeper understanding of ML data — how to engineer training datasets that produce high quality models and test datasets that deliver accurate indicators of how close we are to solving the target problem. \n\n\n\nThe process of creating high quality datasets is complicated and error-prone, from the initial selection and cleaning of raw data, to …",

However, it has been shown that without any protection it is plausible for bad actors to attack a variety of models, across modalities, to reveal information from individual training examples. As such, it’s essential to protect against this sort of information leakage.\n\n\nDifferential privacy (DP) provides formal protection against an attacker who aims to extract information about the training data. The most popular method for DP training in deep learning is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). The core recipe implements a common theme in DP: “fuzzing” an algor…",

They can help with everything from setting alarms to giving map directions and can even assist people with disabilities to more easily manage their homes. As we use these assistants, we are also becoming more accustomed to using natural language to accomplish tasks that we once did by hand. \n\n\n \n\nOne of the biggest challenges in building a robust virtual assistant is identifying what a user wants and what information is needed to perform the task at hand.

It was previously unknown that external eye photos contained signals for these conditions. This exciting finding suggested the potential to reduce the need for specialized equipment since such photos can be captured using smartphones and other consumer devices.
