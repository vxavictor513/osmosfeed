This week also marks the 11th anniversary of This Week in Spring, which I started writing on the first Tuesday of January 2011 thanks to a great idea from SpringSource co-founder and all-around good-guy Keith Donald (@kdonald). \n\r\nWhat a run! As always, I just wanna extend a heartfelt thanks to all of you who read (_suffer!_) my rambling writing every week. We’ve been lucky, as a community, to have presided over the most amazing and uplifting period in Spring and the JVM’s history… This roundup has reflected that with incredible stuff happening all the time. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. The many blogs, articles, podcasts, YouTube (and ever so occasionally Vimeo) videos…",

This last year’s been insanely busy, and one of the things I’ve most loved is all the opportunities to use Spring Native to build GraalVM-powered architecture-specific native images.\n\r\nWe released Spring Native 0.11, which is fantastic because it features a brand new AOT (ahead-of-time) engine that completely reworks how we transpile Spring Boot applications into GraalVM native images. I’ve been working with GraalVM a lot over the last two years, and this new release is a vast, revolutionary step in the story of Spring Native and a giant leap forward on the journey to Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land in 2022. \n\r\nI’ve been tinkering with the new release a lot over the last mont…",

Those libraries tend to have a light touch for the application developer, in the sense that they allow you to completely avoid Javascript, but still have nice a progressive \"modern\" UI. We also look at some more \"pure\" Javascript tools and frameworks.

Technically, we operate each region in a largely stand-alone fashion. Logs, metrics and trace data collected within that region will remain in that region.

To close the IT talent gap, more CIOs are looking to expand the skills of their current workforce, according to a recent McKinsey Global Survey.\nBut effective upskilling and reskilling isn’t simply a matter of paying for IT practitioners to earn certifications in the latest technology. Leaders must decide what options align best with business objectives, specific skills gaps, and rapidly changing learning styles of knowledge workers.\nTo get a front-line perspective on these issues, we interviewed a group of seasoned IT pros for their insights into how enterprise leaders should approach employee training and reskilling challenges.

          "description": "Posted by Karan Singhal, Senior Software Engineer, Google Research  \nFederated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  \n However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…",

However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  \n An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …",

          "description": "Posted by Andrew M Dai and Nan Du, Research Scientists, Google Research, Brain Team  \nLarge language models (e.g., GPT-3) have many significant capabilities, such as performing few-shot learning across a wide array of tasks, including reading comprehension and question answering with very few or no training examples. While these models can perform better by simply using more parameters, training and serving these large models can be very computationally intensive. Is it possible to train and use these models more efficiently? \n  \nIn “GLaM: Efficient Scaling of Language Models with Mixture-of-Experts”, we introduce the Generalist Language Model (GLaM), a trillion weight model that can be trained and served efficiently (in terms of computation and energy use) thanks to sparsity, and achieves…",

          "description": "Posted by Yuanzhong Xu and Yanping Huang, Software Engineers; Google Research, Brain Team  \nScaling neural networks, whether it be the amount of training data used, the model size or the computation being utilized,  has been critical for improving model quality in many real-world machine learning applications, such as computer vision, language understanding and neural machine translation. This, in turn, has motivated recent studies to scrutinize the factors that play a critical role in the success of scaling a neural model. Although increasing model capacity can be a sound approach to improve model quality, doing so presents a number of systems and software engineering challenges that must be overcome. For instance, in order to train large models that exceed the memory capacity of an accel…",

          "description": "Posted by Michael Ryoo, Research Scientist, Robotics at Google and Anurag Arnab, Research Scientist, Google Research \nTransformer models consistently obtain state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks, including object detection and video classification. In contrast to standard convolutional approaches that process images pixel-by-pixel, the Vision Transformers (ViT) treat an image as a sequence of patch tokens (i.e., a smaller part, or “patch”, of an image made up of multiple pixels). This means that at every layer, a ViT model recombines and processes patch tokens based on relations between each pair of tokens, using multi-head self-attention. In doing so, ViT models have the capability to construct a global representation of the entire image. \nAt the input-level, the tokens are fo…",
