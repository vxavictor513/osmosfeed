And of course with Spring Boot 3.0 comes a whole portfolio of integrated projects that have also been updated! Remember, a huge theme in this release is support for GraalVM native images, and that’s now supported across the board. You know what to do: start.spring.io. \n\r\nI put together a Spring Tipds video introducing some of the major themes of Spring Framework 6 / Spring Boot 3. \n\r\n\r\nI also did an in-depth look at the new GraalVM support powered by Spring’s ahead-of-time (AOT) engine. \n\r\n\r\nThere’s so much else to talk about this week, but I really can’t stress this enough: Spring Boot 3 is here! In some ways, it feels like this release has been more than four years in the making! It’s amazing, and I can’t wait f…",

A massive thank you to everyone that has contributed, and to all the early adopters that have been providing vital feedback on the milestones.\n\r\nThis is the first major revision of Spring Boot since 2.0 was released 4.5 years ago. It’s also the first GA version of Spring Boot that provides support for Spring Framework 6.0 and GraalVM. \n\r\nHighlights of the new release include:\n\r\n\r\n  \nA Java 17 baseline\n\r\n  \nSupport for generating native images with GraalVM, superseding the experimental Spring Native project\n\r\n  \nImproved observability with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing\n\r\n  \nSupport for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline\n\r\n\r\nThere’s far too many features to list them all here in detail, so head over to the release notes page on our wiki to find out more. If you just want to get started, you can easily bootstrap a new project on start.spring.io. If you’d like to try out the GraalVM support, start.spring.io can help with that too.\n\r\nOver the coming weeks we’ll be publishing blog posts that cover some Spring Boot 3.0 features in detail.\n\r\nThanks again to everyone that has contributed to Spring and Spring Boot over the years! Supporting Jakarta EE 9 and 10, the observability enhancements, and GraalVM support has been a huge team effort that has left no corner of the Spring portfolio untouched. A special thank you to the developers of the other projects in the Spring portfolio, without whom this release would not have been possible.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow | Gitter",

          "description": "Greetings Spring community,\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Spring Web Services team has released 4.0.0 for general availability. This is the version of Spring WS you’ll need if you are building SOAP-based applications with Spring Boot 3.0.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n4.0.x is the generation of Spring Web Services that works with Jakarta EE 9+, the version where the enterprise specs (JAX-WS, etc.) migrate from javax. to jakarta. package prefixes. Check out Juergen Holler’s blog post for more details about Spring Framework 6.0.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBeing based upon Spring Framework 6.0, this is also the generation of Spring Web Services that is rebased on top of Java 17 (LTS). So check it out!\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor more details, check out our official GitHub release. This includes links to all the related tickets as well as the source code.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have also adopted GitHub releases as our avenue for tracking changes in a given release. All current and prior releases of Spring WS are now captured in the list of releases on GitHub. Feel free to check them out.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe artifacts are hosted on Maven Central so grab 'em while they’re hot!\n\r\n\r\n\r\nProject Page | Source Code | Issues",

          "description": ",\nOn November 5, 2022, at the 2022 Alibaba Cloud Apsara Summit, Elastic won the Alibaba Cloud Product Ecosystem Partner Significant Contribution Award. This award commends and thanks the Partner of Alibaba Cloud for maintaining rapid growth despite the double test of the pandemic and the economy, to promote high-quality development themes of Alibaba cloud. Elastic is the only international partner that has won this honor.\n\n2022 is the new beginning of the second five-year strategic cooperation between Elastic and Alibaba Cloud. The two companies will continue to deepen cooperation in products, services, communities, and ecology to achieve a new leap in high quality.\n,At this conference, the two parties jointly launched the latest Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch serverless version, providing end-to-end data access, data management, data application, and visualization module component capabilities around the Elastic Stack ecological components, as well as scenario-based upper-layer application capabilities. The launch of this version can avoid the complexity of large-scale cluster operation and maintenance, and the cloud native service can achieve second-level elastic scaling without planning and managing cluster resource configuration. By optimizing the cost of computing and storage resources, it can reduce the user's usage cost by 70% on average. This version can efficiently manage and analyze massive data, by decoupling of storage and computing, effectively improve read and write efficiency, and greatly reduce database operation and maintenance management costs.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt84a8ebe85ebdcf28/63764e6371c75510a0c9fcca/blog-elastic-alibaba-apsara.png,blog-elastic-alibaba-apsara.png,\nThe strategic cooperation between Elastic and Alibaba Cloud began in 2017.

But whether or not they exist in reality, studying these hypothetical objects could be the key to making concrete the tantalizing link between information and matter that has bedeviled physicists for decades.  \n  \nSurprisingly, a quantum computer is an ideal platform to investigate this connection.

For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale.

Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network.

          "description": "Posted by Rishabh Agarwal, Senior Research Scientist, and Max Schwarzer, Student Researcher, Google Research, Brain Team  \nReinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on training intelligent agents using related experiences so they can learn to solve decision making tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons, and designing hardware chips. Due to the generality of RL, the prevalent trend in RL research is to develop agents that can efficiently learn tabula rasa, that is, from scratch without using previously learned knowledge about the problem. However, in practice, tabula rasa RL systems are typically the exception rather than the norm for solving large-scale RL problems. Large-scale RL systems, such as OpenAI Five, which achieves human-le…",

While these programs can be expressive, re-programming policies for each new task can be time consuming, and requires domain expertise.\n\nWhat if when given instructions from people, robots could autonomously write their own code to interact with the world? It turns out that the latest generation of language models, such as PaLM, are capable of complex reasoning and have also been trained on millions of lines of code. Given natural language instructions, current language models are highly proficien…",
