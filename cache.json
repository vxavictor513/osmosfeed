Here, we will examine benchmark solutions to compare various methods in a fair manner. Note that the task of benchmarking is not straightforward and can lead to misperceptions about how models perform in real-world scenarios.\nHistorically, comparisons between BM25 and learned retrieval models have been based on limited data sets, or even only on the training data set of these dense models: MSMARCO, which may not provide an accurate representation of the models' performance on your data. Despite this approach being useful for demonstrating how well a dense model performs against BM25 in a specific domain, it does not capture one of BM25's key strength…",

Each are goals of Event-Driven Ansible, which seeks to further the reach of Ansible based automation by responding to events that meet certain criteria. These events can originate from a variety of sources, such as from an HTTP endpoint, messages on a queue or topic, or from public cloud resources. Kubernetes has become synonymous with managing infrastructure and applications in cloud native architectures and many organizations are reliant on these systems for running their business critical workloads. Automation and Kubernetes go hand in hand and Ansible already plays a role within this ecosystem. A new capability leveraging the Event-Driven Ansible framework is now available that extends the integration between both Ansible and Kubernetes so that Ansible automation activities can be triggered based on events and actions occurring within a Kubernetes cluster.",

Building robots that are proficient at navigation requires an interconnected understanding of (a) vision and natural language (to associate landmarks or follow instructions), and (b) spatial reasoning (to connect a map representing an environment to the true spatial distribution of objects).

Understanding the content of videos, however, is a challenging task as videos often contain multiple events occurring at different time scales. For example, a video of a musher hitching up dogs to a dog sled before they all race away involves a long event (the dogs pulling the sled) and a short event (the dogs being hitched to the sled).
