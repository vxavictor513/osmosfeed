          "description": ",\nThe IT sector is one of the most dynamic and innovative industries in the world. However, it also faces a serious challenge of finding and retaining qualified talent. The Australian Information Industry Association (AIIA) survey for 2023 revealed that skill shortages are the single biggest inhibitor to business growth in Australia. The survey also found that 49% of IT graduates in Australia needed further training to be effective employees. To address this issue, the University of Canberra (UC) is committed to delivering work-ready graduates who can meet the industry’s needs and expectations. One of the ways UC does this is by offering its final year students Capstone projects, which help them apply and improve their skills for their future careers.\nElastic®, a leading provider of softwa…",

At its core, semantic search is a method of search that uses AI to return more relevant search results. Take a look at this quick video explaining the concept:\n,As shown in the video, semantic search matches the intent of what the user searches to the content available rather than the words.

The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency.

However, because of uncertainties about processes that are small in scale yet globally important, such as clouds and ocean turbulence, these models’ predictions of upcoming climate changes are not very accurate in detail. For example, predictions of the time by which the global mean surface temperature of Earth will have warmed 2℃, relative to preindustrial times, vary by 40–50 years (a full human generation) among today’s models. As a result, we do not have the accurate and geographically granular predictions we need to plan resilient infrastructure, adapt supply chains to climate disruption, and assess the risks of…",

For example, audio, video, and text all provide varied and complementary information about a visual input. However, building multimodal models is challenging due to the heterogeneity of the modalities. Some of the modalities might be well synchronized in time (e.g., audio, video) but not aligned with text.

Two of the most prevalent error mechanisms are bit-flip errors (where the energy state of the qubit changes) and phase-flip errors (where the phase of the encoded quantum information changes). Quantum error correction (QEC) promises to address and mitigate these two prominent errors.

Transformer neural networks (transformers) are a popular deep learning architecture that today comprise the foundation for most tasks in natural language processing and also are starting to extend to applications in other domains, such as computer vision, robotics, and autonomous driving. Moreover, they form the backbone of all the current state-of-the-art language models.\n \n\nIncreasing scale in Transformer networks has led to improved performance and the emergence of behavior not present in smaller networks. However, this increase in scale often comes with pr…",

The standard forms of clustering are metric clustering and graph clustering. In metric clustering, a given metric space defines distances between data points, which are grouped together based on their separation. In graph clustering, a given graph connects similar data points through edges, and the clustering process groups data points together based on the connections between them. Both clustering forms are particularly useful for large corpora where class labels can’t be defined. Examples of such corpora are the ever-growing digital text collections of variou…",

This is impressive because in the few-shot setup, LLMs are presented with only a few question-answer demonstrations prior to being given a test question. Even more challenging is the zero-shot setup, where the LLM is directly prompted with the test question only. \n\n\n\n\nEven though the few-shot setup has dramatically reduced the amount of data required to adapt a model for a specific use-case, there are still cases where generating sample prompts can be challenging.
