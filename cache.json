Over the years, a lot gets accumulated and sometimes is forgotten until found in a corner. \n\nThis blog identifies steps you can take to reduce the pain typically associated with a migration, tools that can help along the way, and questions you should ask during each phase of a migration.\nWhy migrate?\nSIEMs are a significant investment, and once deployed, organizations typically use the same technology for many years. The solutions require a lot of time to be maintained and tuned to meet an organization’s needs, cover all necessary security use cases, ingest all required data sources, and meet any other business needs.\n\nOver time, however, you may start t…",

Each are goals of Event-Driven Ansible, which seeks to further the reach of Ansible based automation by responding to events that meet certain criteria. These events can originate from a variety of sources, such as from an HTTP endpoint, messages on a queue or topic, or from public cloud resources. Kubernetes has become synonymous with managing infrastructure and applications in cloud native architectures and many organizations are reliant on these systems for running their business critical workloads. Automation and Kubernetes go hand in hand and Ansible already plays a role within this ecosystem. A new capability leveraging the Event-Driven Ansible framework is now available that extends the integration between both Ansible and Kubernetes so that Ansible automation activities can be triggered based on events and actions occurring within a Kubernetes cluster.",

It was previously unknown that external eye photos contained signals for these conditions.

          "description": "Posted by Florian Hartmann, Software Engineer, and Peter Kairouz, Research Scientist, Google Research  \nFederated learning is a distributed way of training machine learning (ML) models where data is locally processed and only focused model updates and metrics that are intended for immediate aggregation are shared with a server that orchestrates training. This allows the training of models on locally available signals without exposing raw data to servers, increasing user privacy. In 2021, we announced that we are using federated learning to train Smart Text Selection models, an Android feature that helps users select and copy text easily by predicting what text they want to select and then automatically expanding the selection for them. \n \nSince that launch, we have worked to improve the pr…",

          "description": "Posted by Minji Yoon, Research Intern, and Bryan Perozzi, Research Scientist, Google Research, Graph Mining Team  \nIndustrial applications of machine learning are commonly composed of various items that have differing data modalities or feature distributions. Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) offer a unified view of these multimodal data systems by defining multiple types of nodes (for each data type) and edges (for the relation between data items). For instance, e-commerce networks might have [user, product, review] nodes or video platforms might have [channel, user, video, comment] nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings summarizing each node’s relationships into a vector. However, in real world HGs, there is often a label imbalance issue between different node …",
