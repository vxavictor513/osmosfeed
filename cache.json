The pandemic sparked a digital surge, with health.gov.au clocking 6 million daily visits, and servicesaustralia.gov.au witnessing a 650% boost in activity. This points to the urgent need for efficient, seamless service delivery. Embracing transformative tools like OpenAI's GPT-4, Bard, and Elasticsearch® can spark a revolution in service delivery, potentially enhancing citizen satisfaction and inclusivity.\n\nIn the context of a “digital first” approach and a swell in online traffic, monitoring public sector IT environments has become crucial.

Participating in the growth and maturity of security as a business function has been an amazing journey. I have learned a lot of lessons on my own, through my personal experiences, or via my peers.\n\nOne thing I was not able to do was learn from experienced CISOs that have time and distance to reflect on how to best be successful as a CISO. I would have saved myself some painful lessons if I knew these foundational rules in the past. \n\nThe role of chief information security officer (CISO) — and equivalent roles — is a high-stakes position. To thrive, CISOs must master a unique blend of technical expertise, business acumen, and people skills. \n\nIn addition to the “head’s down” day-to-day functions — strategy, risk management, vendor/partner management, security assurance, governance, etc. — there’s a more important side of the job. Internal collaboration and communication with other executives, department heads, and stakeholders helps CISOs align security initiatives with business objectives. This includes participating in board meetings, aligning with business strategy, providing security updates, and collaborating with cross-functional teams.\n\nBy understanding their organization's DNA and cultivating a collaborative security culture, CISOs can make an indelible impact on their organization's cybersecurity resilience while maximizing their personal performance.\n\nDrawing from the collective wisdom of industry experts, experienced cybersecurity professionals, and, of course, fellow CISOs, we explore the core principles that separate exceptional CISOs from the rest. From this discussion, we present 10 rules for security leadership:\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4a4d037f724966c1/64efc0f18b0a2683e12688b1/10_rules_CISO_listicles.png,10_rules_CISO_listicles.png",

Scholars and decision makers are exploring what generative AI means for personalized learning, integrity and ethics, and academic research, as well as preparing students for an AI-powered workplace.\n\nIn addition to pedagogical impacts, generative AI also has the potential to transform the IT landscape at universities. Specifically, when generative AI applications are used with a university’s internal data, they can produce hyper-relevant, context rich outputs that can increase productivity and job satisfaction…",

But there are still a few pain points within vector search that need to be addressed. A major one is text embedding models and handling larger text input. \n\nWhere lexical search like BM25 is already designed for long documents, text embedding models are not. All embedding models have limitations on the number of tokens they can embed. So, for longer text input it must be chunked into passages shorter than the model’s limit. Now instead of having one document with all its metadata, you have multiple passages and embeddings. And if you want to preserve your metadata, it must be added to every new document.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3…",

Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim\nadmission validation mechanism within\nthe API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.\nHow to use it?\nAs this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.\nSimply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.\nFor more details, read about\ndefault StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.\n\n\nAdaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…",
