Providers must maintain a vulnerability management program, implement strong access controls, regularly monitor and test networks, and follow other standards that cover technical and operational system components.\nElastic, in conjunction with a third-party auditor, completed a PCI Data Security Standards Level 1 Service Provider assessment and was found to be compliant by the PCI Security Standards Committee’s Cloud Computing Guidelines. Elastic customers may request our PCI Responsibility Matrix, which details how compliance roles and responsibilities are shared between Elastic and its customers when working with PCI data.\nCustomers also have the option to request our PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance (AOC), an attestation completed by a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA) that documents the evidence that Elastic upholds security best practices to protect cardholder data. Upon request, customers receive a copy of our Report on Compliance (ROC), detailing Elastic’s security posture, environment, systems, and protection of cardholder data.\nHave an Elastic Cloud use case that requires PCI DSS compliance?

Earlier models like BERT (with a parameter size of < 1GB) can efficiently scale across accelerators by leveraging data parallelism in which model weights are duplicated across accelerators while only partitioning and distributing the training data. However, recent large models like GPT-3 (with a parameter size of 175GB) can only scale using model parallel training, where a single model is partitioned across different devices.  \n While model parallelism strategies make it possible to train large models, they are more complex in that th…",

The complexity arises when trying to identify or localize all object instances while also avoiding duplication. Existing approaches, like Faster R-CNN and DETR, are carefully designed and highly customized in the choice of architecture and loss function. This specialization of existing systems has created two major barriers: (1) it adds complexity in tuning and training the different parts of the system (e.g., region proposal network, graph matching with GIOU loss, etc.), and (2), it can reduce the ability of a model to generalize, necessitating a redesign of the model for…",

Ordinary supervised learning trains on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, where all training examples are sampled from a fixed set of classes, and the model has access to these examples throughout the entire training phase. In contrast, continual learning tackles the problem of training a single model on changing data distributions where different classification tasks are presented sequentially. This is particularly important, for example, to enable autonomous agents to process and interpret continuous streams of informati…",

It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning, whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals). Previous works such as BiT and ViT employed these methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of classification tasks, such as the VTAB benchmark. \nHowever, fine-tuning has some downsides: though pre-training is done only once, fine-tuning is necessary on every new dataset for which task-specific data is needed.

In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. \nDespite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks.
