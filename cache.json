          "description": "Yesterday we announced a Spring Framework RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, listing Apache Tomcat as one of several preconditions. The Apache Tomcat team has since released versions 10.0.20, 9.0.62, and 8.5.78 all of which close the attack vector on Tomcat’s side. While the vulnerability is not in Tomcat itself, in real world situations, it is important to be able to choose among multiple upgrade paths that in turn provides flexibility and layered protection. \n\r\nUpgrading to Spring Framework 5.3.18+ or 5.2.20+ continues to be our main recommendation not only because it addresses the root cause and prevents other possible attack vectors, but also because it adds protection for other CVEs addressed since the current version in use. \n\r\nFor older, unsupported versions of the Spring Framework, the Tomcat releases provide an adequate solution for the reported attack vector. Nevertheless, we must stress that this should only be seen as a tactical solution, while the main goal should still be to upgrade to a currently supported Spring Framework version as soon as possible.\n\r\nLast but not least, it’s worth mentioning that downgrading to Java 8 provides another viable workaround, which may be another tactical solution option.",

A long word, you may be wondering what it really means and how you can add it to your skillset. Here’s a quick primer to get you going on your path to observability.\nWhere did the term “observability” come from?\nThe concept of observability dates back to the mid-20th century, where it was originally used in control theory to describe how the internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of the system’s external outputs. Rudolf E. Kalman, a Hungarian-American electrical engineer and mathematician, coined the term in the 1960s in several seminal papers around dynamical and observable systems. \nWhile the term is still used in the math…",

This is not uncommon and can be frustrating if a person is looking for something specific. As a designer of such a system, it is also not uncommon for the metrics measured to change from design and testing to deployment, bringing into question the utility of the experimental testing phase. Some level of such irreproducibility can be expected as the world changes and new models are deployed.

Huggins, Research Scientist, Google Quantum AI \nThe intersection between the computational difficulty and practical importance of quantum chemistry challenges run on quantum computers has long been a focus for Google Quantum AI. We’ve experimentally simulated simple models of chemical bonding, high-temperature superconductivity, nanowires, and even exotic phases of matter such as time crystals on our Sycamore quantum processors. We’ve also developed algorithms suitable for the error-corrected quantum computers we aim to build, including the world’s most efficient algorithm for large-scale quantum computations of chemistry (in the usual way of formulating the problem) and a pioneering approach that allows for us to solve the same problem at an extremely high spatial res…",

As real-world data consists of various signals that co-occur, such as video frames and audio tracks, web images and their captions and instructional videos and speech transcripts, it is natural to apply a similar logic when building and designing multimodal machine learning (ML) models.  \n Effective multimodal models have wide applications — such as multilingual image retrieval, future action prediction, and vision-language navigation — and are important for several reasons; robustness, which …",

This effort has been emphasized in Europe, where aviation accounts for 13.9% of the transportation industry’s carbon emissions. The largest push comes from the European Green Deal, which aims to decrease carbon emissions from transportation by 90% by 2051. The Lufthansa Group has gone even further, committing to a 50% reduction in emissions compared to 2019 by the year 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.  \n One unexpected approach that airlines can use to lower carbon emissions is through optimizing their tail assignment, i.e., how to assign air…",

However, training models for video recognition often requires untrimmed videos to be manually annotated, which can be prohibitively time consuming. In order to reduce the effort of collecting videos with annotations, learning visual knowledge from videos with weak labels, i.e., where the annotation is auto-generated without manual intervention, has attracted growing research interest, thanks to the large volume of easily accessible video data. Untrimmed videos, for example, are often acquired by querying with keywords for classes that the video recognition model aims to classify.…",
