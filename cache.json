          "description": "Yesterday we announced a Spring Framework RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, listing Apache Tomcat as one of several preconditions. The Apache Tomcat team has since released versions 10.0.20, 9.0.62, and 8.5.78 all of which close the attack vector on Tomcat’s side. While the vulnerability is not in Tomcat itself, in real world situations, it is important to be able to choose among multiple upgrade paths that in turn provides flexibility and layered protection. \n\r\nUpgrading to Spring Framework 5.3.18+ or 5.2.20+ continues to be our main recommendation not only because it addresses the root cause and prevents other possible attack vectors, but also because it adds protection for other CVEs addressed since the current version in use. \n\r\nFor older, unsupported versions of the Spring Framework, the Tomcat releases provide an adequate solution for the reported attack vector. Nevertheless, we must stress that this should only be seen as a tactical solution, while the main goal should still be to upgrade to a currently supported Spring Framework version as soon as possible.\n\r\nLast but not least, it’s worth mentioning that downgrading to Java 8 provides another viable workaround, which may be another tactical solution option.",

Recent sequence modeling, which is a self-attention mechanism that directly models relationships between all words in a selection of text, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on natural language tasks. A natural approach to handle form document understanding tasks is to first serialize the form documents (usually in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom fashion) and then apply state-of-the-art sequence models to them.  \n However, form documents often have more complex layouts …",

Ordinary supervised learning trains on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, where all training examples are sampled from a fixed set of classes, and the model has access to these examples throughout the entire training phase. In contrast, continual learning tackles the problem of training a single model on changing data distributions where different classification tasks are presented sequentially.

It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning, whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals). Previous works such as BiT and ViT employed these methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of classification tasks, such as the VTAB benchmark. \nHowever, fine-tuning has some downsides: though pre-training is done only once, fine-tuning is necessary on every new dataset for which task-specific data is needed.

Adding this functionality can be difficult — for each new task, one needs to collect new data and retrain the models that power the conversational agent. This is because most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models are trained on a single task-specific ontology. An ontology is generally represented as a list of possible user intents (e.g., if the user wants to book a flight, if the user wants to play some music, etc.) and possible parameter slots to extract from the conversation (e.g., the date of the flight, the…",

LiDAR, which is a remote sensing technique that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges, provides low-resolution shape and depth information, while cameras provide high-resolution shape and texture information. While the features captured by LiDAR and cameras should be merged together to provide optimal 3D object detection, it turns out that most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors use LiDAR as the only input.

In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. \nDespite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks.
