The individual who feels the side believes the elephant to be a wall, the one who touches the tusk thinks it's a spear, and so forth. Subsequently, they argue fiercely, each convinced that their perception of the elephant is the whole truth. \nhttps://static-www.ela…",

          "description": "Posted by Jiefeng Chen, Student Researcher, and Jinsung Yoon, Research Scientist, Cloud AI Team\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact with machines, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation to unprecedented heights.

Traditional LLMs generate responses recursively, yet they lack an intrinsic mechanism to assign a confidence score to these responses. Although one can derive a confidence score by summing up the probabilities of individual tokens in the sequence, traditional approaches typically fall short in reliably dist…",
