Microservice-based systems have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has also regained popularity recently.\r\nIndependent of the architectural style ultimately selected, the individual applications comprising the overall system need their structure to be evolvable and able to follow changes in business requirements.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTraditionally, application frameworks have provided structural guidance by providing abstractions aligned with technical concepts, such as Spring Framework’s stereotype annotations (@Controller, @Service, @Repository, and so on).\r\nHowever, shifting the focus to align code structure with the domain has pro…",

          "description": ",\nAt Elastic, many of our Elasticians love cycling and exploring new and unique patches of road. We also love data analysis and visualization. I started to plan my upcoming cycling trip on Komoot. Planning a one-week trip with six rides is tricky, as you are hovering over the map and trying to find unique routes. Who wants to ride the same road multiple times?\n\nAfter I was done planning in Komoot, I thought to myself: is there a way to identify if I am riding this road once, twice, or even more often? I also wanted to plot it and look at the data a bit more dynamically.\n\nThis is our goal today. Let’s build a dashboard that shows this information.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/bltbd0372ed19956db5/635c2b306b46ec106a2eb7a2/blog-elastic-uniqueroads-1.png,blog-elas…",

This is what we call the shared responsibility model in which every part of the cloud, including the hardware, data, configurations, access rights, and operating system, are protected. Depending on the local legislation and the origin of the data that is handled (for instance laws like HIPAA, the GDPR in Europe, or the Californian CCPA),  you may have to enforce strict rules on your environment and log events for audit purposes. AWS CloudTrail will help you to achieve this goal. The service can collect and record any kind of information coming from your environment and store or send the events to a destination for audit. In addition to security and compliance, this service helps keep track of resource consumption.",

Through this process, organizations collect and analyze data, and determine if a program is performing as expected within set boundaries.

One essential aspect of monitoring is the list of key metrics you want to observe. There are different categories of statistics that can be of interest here. To observe the defined metrics, there are plenty of application monitoring tools on the market today.

Image quality assessment (IQA) uses models to build a bridge between an image and a user's subjective perception of its quality. In the deep learning era, many IQA approaches, such as NIMA, have achieved success by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based IQA models are often constrained by the fixed-size input requirement in batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized or cropped to a fixed size shape. This preprocessing is problematic for IQA because images can have very different aspect ratios and resolutions…",

          "description": "Posted by Manoj Kumar, Research Engineer, and Ekin Dogus Cubuk, Research Scientist, Google Research \nThe task of determining the similarity between images is an open problem in computer vision and is crucial for evaluating the realism of machine-generated images. Though there are a number of straightforward methods of estimating image similarity (e.g., low-level metrics that measure pixel differences, such as FSIM and SSIM), in many cases, the measured similarity differences do not match the differences perceived by a person. However, more recent work has demonstrated that intermediate representations of neural network classifiers, such as AlexNet, VGG and SqueezeNet trained on ImageNet, exhibit perceptual similarity as an emergent property. That is, Euclidean distances between encoded rep…",

It is less common to see robot learning applied to dynamic, high-acceleration tasks requiring tight-loop human-robot interactions, such as table tennis. There are two complementary properties of the table tennis task that make it interesting for robotic learning research. First, the task requires both speed and precision, which puts significant demands on a learning algorithm. At the same time, the problem is highly-structured (with a fixed, predictable environment) and naturally multi-agent (the robot can play with humans or another robot), makin…",

Improving the quality of language models is a key target for researchers to make progress toward such a goal.   \n\nMost common paradigms to build and train language models use either autoregressive decoder-only architectures (e.g., PaLM or GPT-3), where the model is trained to predict the next word for a given prefix phrase, or span corruption-based encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, ST-MoE), where the training objective is to recover the subset of words masked out of the input.
