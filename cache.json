To ensure that our customers and the broader community can benefit from standardization, Elastic is committed to developing a common schema for metrics, logs, traces, and security events based on the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) and OpenTelemetry (OTel).  \nElastic is contributing ECS to OTel and committing to joint development of a common schema. OTel is the second highest velocity project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), and provides a collection of tools,…",

As the technology continues to improve and robotic agents are more routinely deployed in real-world environments, their capacity to assist in day-to-day activities will take on increasing importance. Repetitive tasks like wiping surfaces, folding clothes, and cleaning a room seem well-suited for robots, but remain challenging for robotic systems designed for structured environments like factories. Performing these types of tasks in more complex environments, like offices or homes, requires dealing with greater levels of environmental variability captured by high-dimensional sensor…",
