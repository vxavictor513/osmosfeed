At the time, I would use it to play games.”\n\nThis early interest in technology was further reinforced when Simona took programming classes in high school. She found she loved learning basic algorithms and languages like C, so she decided to marry her passion with her career.\n\n17 years later, she’s a director of engineering at Elastic.\n\nWe caught up with Simona to hear how she transitioned into management and developed a winning strategy for leading her team.

Typically accessed through voice assistants or messaging apps, these interfaces simulate human conversation in order to help users resolve their queries more efficiently.\n\nAs technology advances, chatbots are used to handle more complex tasks — and quickly — while still providing a personalized experience for users. Natural language processing (NLP) enables chatbots to process the user's language, identifies the intent behind their message, and extracts relevant information from it. For example, Named Entity Recognition extracts key information in a text by classifying them into a set…",

Admittingly, back then my focus was solely on figuring out how to best demonstrate to my customers the power of having a OpenStack private cloud. Anyone who has ever stood up or experimented with OpenStack knows that this is a tall order. Imagine having to stand up that platform over and over again on a daily basis. My focus was to find a way—a tool—that could help me do that, so I could focus on helping solve the customers' true challenges. Fast forward to now, and the decision to do it with Ansible still stands as the best choice hands down.",

It improves bit by bit, one little step at a time — editing, running unit tests, fixing build errors, addressing code reviews, editing some more, appeasing linters, and fixing more errors — until finally it becomes good enough to merge into a code repository. Software engineering isn’t an isolated process, but a dialogue among human developers, code reviewers, bug reporters, software architects and tools, such as compilers, unit tests, linters and static analyzers. \n\n\n\n\nToday we describe DIDACT (​​Dynamic Integrated Developer ACTivity), which is a methodology for training large machine learning (ML) models for software development.

Furthermore, the reference genome didn’t represent the vast diversity of human ancestries, making it less useful for detecting disease or finding cures for people from some backgrounds than others. For the past three years, we have been pa…",
