          "description": "In the fast-evolving landscape of business operations, telecommunications procurement departments are pivotal in spearheading cost efficiencies and technological advancements. A significant challenge in this realm is the management of disparate software solutions from multiple vendors. Telecom companies deal with complex systems, and having multiple tools that don't integrate well can lead to inefficiencies. This often results in overlapping data and functionalities, leading to inflated costs and complexities in maintenance, integration, and training. The diverse renewal cycles, compliance demands, and disparate usage tracking methodologies further complicate the formulation of an efficient and cost-effective IT strategy.\nThe release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

The memo outlined a logging maturity model with four tiers (E0-3) to guide agencies in their compliance process.\n\nIn the new study, GAO found that agencies “have made progress in preparing for and responding to cyber threats.” At the same time, however, the study noted that 20 of the 23 agencies did not meet M-21-31’s tier 3 advanced event logging (“advanced EL3”) August deadline for tracking, storing, and managing event logs.\n\nThe study highlighted three challenges agencies are facing as they work to meet M-21-31 event logging requirements: \n\n\nLack of staff\n\nEvent logging technical challenges\n\nLimitations in cyber event information sharing\n\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk through these challenges and share how we’ve seen federal customers address them using Elasticsearch®.\nThe release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

Logs, however, are often structured at a developer’s whim and, first and foremost, serve the developer’s needs (e.g., debugging). Once in production, these same log lines are inherently promoted to a first-class means of observing your applications and infrastructure, regardless of their original intent. This makes logs a notoriously noisy observability signal whose rate can swing wildly with errors and scale.\n\nThe simplicity of the log line as an observability signal (fundamentally, it’s just text!) makes it deceivingly simple to observe.

The right MSP not only provides deep technical expertise and 24/7 monitoring and management of your infrastructure, but it can also improve core operational and procedural challenges over time to help you reduce costs and streamline operations, so your IT team can focus on projects that accelerate your business.\nReady to engage with an Elastic Verified MSP?\nWhether you want to leverage Elastic within your data center or via the cloud, here are eight areas to consider when selecting a MSP:\n\nSupport: Ensure that your preferred MSP offers 24/7 support and security operation center(s) across time zones.\n\nPricing: Review pricing models to make sure it fits within your resources.\n\nBreadth of services: Consider your needs today, but also what you might need in one, three, or five years. Choose an MSP with a wide range of services so you’re able to grow together and build a lasting partnership. \n\nCloud or hybrid posture: What is your current environment? Make sure your MSP supports your model.\n\nService offerings: Inquire about additional offerings, like consulting or migration services.\n\nReferences: Ask to see validated customer references and testimonials.\n\nCertifications and clearances: If your industry is regulated, ensure that your MSP has the right certifications and clearances. \n\nVerified: Consider choosing an MSP who is Elastic Verified. This ensures the MSP has the correct architecture design, proof of 24/7 support, Elastic-certified engineers, successful customer deployments, and more.\n\nOur current list of our Verified MSP partners includes:",

AI systems capable of such diagnostic dialogues could increase availability, accessibility, quality and consistency of care by being useful conversational partners to clinicians and patients alike. But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. \n\n\n\n\n\nRecent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations. However, there are many aspects of good diagnostic dialogue that are unique to the medical domain. …",

Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.\n\n\n\nThis has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…",

In many cases, even the current leading models either generate small motion or, when producing larger motions, exhibit noticeable artifacts.\n \n\nTo explore the application of language models in video generation, we introduce VideoPoet (website, research paper), a large language model (LLM) that is capable of a wide variety of video generation tasks, including text-to-video, image-to-video, video stylization, video inpainting and outpainting, and video-to-audio.

Two thousand years later, this design continues to work well to move enormous crowds out of sporting and entertainment venues.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, exiting the arena is only the first step. Next, people must navigate the traffic that builds up in the surrounding streets. This is an age-old problem that remains unsolved to this day.
