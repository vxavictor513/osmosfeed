These details allow looking behind the curtains of the anomaly scoring algorithm.\nWe have written about anomaly scoring and normalization in this blog before. The anomaly detection algorithm analyzes time series of data in an online fashion. It identifies trends and periodic patterns on different time scales, such as a day, a week, a month, or a year.

For example, a website or a web service gets HTTP requests and sends back responses in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.). For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.\nThe structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.\nThere are a few considerations to make such an application work wel…",

Companies that are distributed have an ethos that where you do your work doesn’t impact your performance. Working remotely is at the individual level.

DP quantifies the “privacy cost” of an algorithm, i.e., the level of guarantee that the algorithm’s output distribution for a given dataset will not change significantly if a single user’s data is added to or removed from it. The algorithm is characterized by two parameters, ε and δ, where smaller values of both indicate “more private”.
