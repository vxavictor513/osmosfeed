          "description": ",\nPersonally identifiable information (PII) compliance is an ever-increasing challenge for any organization. Whether you’re in ecommerce, banking, healthcare, or other fields where data is sensitive, PII may inadvertently be captured and stored. Having structured logs enables quick identification, removal, and protection of sensitive data fields easily; but what about unstructured messages? Or perhaps call center transcriptions?\nElasticsearch, with its long experience in machine learning, provides various options to bring in custom models, such as large language models (LLMs), and provides its own models. These models will help implement PII redaction. \nIf you would like to learn more about natural language processing, machine learning, and Elastic, please be sure to check out these relate…",

Modification and\nremoval of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,\nbut that’s a small subset of its capabilities.\nAnother core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles.

Intuition and the laws of quantum mechanics agree: If the objects are truly identical, there is no way to tell. \n\n\n\nWhile this sounds like common sense, it only applies to our familiar three-dimensional world.

With the quick pace of announcements on stage, it can be difficult to convey the substantial effort and unique innovations that underlie the technologies we presented. So today, we’re excited to reveal more about the research efforts behind some of the many compelling announcements at this year's I/O. \n\n\n \n\nPaLM 2 \nPaLM 2, is built on advances in compute-optimal scaling, scaled instruction-fine tuning and improved dataset mixture.

As part of this process, the reviewer inspects the proposed code and asks the author for code changes through comments written in natural language. At Google, we see millions of reviewer comments per year, and authors require an average of ~60 minutes active shepherding time between sending changes for review and finally submitting the change. In our measurements, the required active work time that the code author must do to address reviewer comments grows almost linearly with the number of comme…",
