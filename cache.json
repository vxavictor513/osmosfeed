          "description": ",\nIndustrial control systems (ICS) have historically been isolated and less interconnected. Isolation was one of the things that kept these systems more secure behind air gaps, at the cost of lost coordination and collaboration. This is rapidly changing with the rise of Industry 4.0 with increased interconnectivity and integration of smart technologies like Industrial IoT (IIoT) and cloud computing in modern industrial processes.\n\nThis blog walks through the security challenges associated with ICS and how Elastic Security and Zeek can help address them, in addition to the benefits of having integrated machine learning and threat intelligence within the ICS security program.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt1e29f607dfe021f0/6453c12670a4470c7a8b2282/blog-elastic…",

          "description": ",\nElasticsearch is used for a wide variety of data types — one of these is metrics. With the introduction of Metricbeat many years ago and later our APM Agents, the metric use case has become more popular. Over the years, Elasticsearch has made many improvements on how to handle things like metrics aggregations and sparse documents. At the same time, TSVB visualizations were introduced to make visualizing metrics easier. One concept that was missing that exists for most other metric solutions is the concept of time series with dimensions. \n\nMid 2021, the Elasticsearch team embarked on making Elasticsearch a much better fit for metrics. The team created Time Series Data Streams (TSDS), which were released in 8.7 as generally available (GA). \n\nThis blog post dives into how TSDS works and how…",

          "description": ",\nThe robotics industry has experienced significant growth in recent years, with the global robotics market size expected to reach US$230 billion by 2025. This growth is largely driven by the increasing adoption of automation and robotics in various industries, including manufacturing, healthcare, logistics, and more. The integration of automation and robotics with Industry 4.0 technologies has brought new challenges, including the management and analysis of large amounts of data generated by connected devices and sensors, which is estimated to generate around 4.4 zettabytes of data per year.\n\nThe Robot Operating System (ROS) is an open-source framework that provides a standardized way of developing robotic applications.

The highly dynamic nature of cloud environments, where new resources are constantly being added and removed, poses new challenges. One of the main challenges organizations face is the lack of visibility into the cloud environment. As cloud computing continues to grow in complexity, it can be challenging to keep track of all the different resources and applications that make up the infrastructure. This lack of visibility can make it difficult to maintain security policies and configurations, making the infrastructure vulnerable to attacks.",
