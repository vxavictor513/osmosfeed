A massive thank you to everyone that has contributed, and to all the early adopters that have been providing vital feedback on the milestones.\n\r\nThis is the first major revision of Spring Boot since 2.0 was released 4.5 years ago. It’s also the first GA version of Spring Boot that provides support for Spring Framework 6.0 and GraalVM. \n\r\nHighlights of the new release include:\n\r\n\r\n  \nA Java 17 baseline\n\r\n  \nSupport for generating native images with GraalVM, superseding the experimental Spring Native project\n\r\n  \nImproved observability with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing\n\r\n  \nSupport for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline\n\r\n\r\nThere’s far too many features to list them all here in detail, so head over to the release notes page on our wiki to find out more. If you just want to get started, you can easily bootstrap a new project on start.spring.io. If you’d like to try out the GraalVM support, start.spring.io can help with that too.\n\r\nOver the coming weeks we’ll be publishing blog posts that cover some Spring Boot 3.0 features in detail.\n\r\nThanks again to everyone that has contributed to Spring and Spring Boot over the years! Supporting Jakarta EE 9 and 10, the observability enhancements, and GraalVM support has been a huge team effort that has left no corner of the Spring portfolio untouched. A special thank you to the developers of the other projects in the Spring portfolio, without whom this release would not have been possible.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow | Gitter",

It can be overwhelming to keep up with incoming chat messages and documents that arrive at our inbox everyday. This has been exacerbated by the increase in virtual work and remains a challenge as many teams transition to a hybrid work environment with a mix of those working both virtually and in an office. One solution that can address information overload is summarization — for example, to help users improve their productivity and better manage so much information, we recently introduced auto-generated summaries in Google Docs.  \n\nToday, we are excited to introduce conv…",

However, knowledge about datasets, including use and implementations, is often distributed across teams, individuals, and even time. Earlier this year at the ACM Conference on Fairness, Accountability, and Transparency (ACM FAccT), we published Data Cards, a dataset documentation framework aimed at increasing transparency across dataset lifecycles.

          "description": "Posted by Yanqi Zhou, Research Scientist, Google Research, Brain Team  \nThe capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by the number of its parameters, and as a consequence, finding more effective ways to increase model parameters has become a trend in deep learning research. Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network. Such models have demonstrated better scaling in multiple domains and…",
