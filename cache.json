          "description": "This blog gives an update on the Schema Registry support that is part of Spring Cloud Stream version 4.0.x. \n\r\nMany enterprises use a schema registry for schema evolution use cases, such as the Confluent Schema Registry. Starting with version 1.1.x of Spring Cloud Stream until 3.0.0, we provided a schema registry server and AVRO-based schema registry client converters that can reconcile the schema from the schema registry server. Spring Cloud Stream version 3.0.0 moved the Schema Registry components into a top-level spring-cloud project, and Spring Cloud Stream included those in its BOM for the end user applications to consume them. However, this didn’t scale well, and with the 3.2 version, we decided to stop having them as part of the Spring Cloud Stream BOM. \n\r\nThe schema registry use ca…",

This is what we call the shared responsibility model in which every part of the cloud, including the hardware, data, configurations, access rights, and operating system, are protected. Depending on the local legislation and the origin of the data that is handled (for instance laws like HIPAA, the GDPR in Europe, or the Californian CCPA),  you may have to enforce strict rules on your environment and log events for audit purposes. AWS CloudTrail will help you to achieve this goal. The service can collect and record any kind of information coming from your environment and store or send the events to a destination for audit. In addition to security and compliance, this service helps keep track of resource consumption.",

Scaling up the size of language models often leads to improved performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks. In many cases, the performance of a large language model can be predicted by extrapolating the performance trend of smaller models. For instance, the effect of scale on language model perplexity has been empirically shown to span more than seven orders of magnitude. \n\nOn the other hand, performance for certain other tasks does not improve in a predictable fashion. For example, the GPT-3 paper showed that the ability of language models to perform mult…",

However, with chain-of-thought prompting, a model is not grounded in the external world and uses its own internal representations to generate reasoning traces, limiting its ability to reactively explore and reason or update its knowledge.

Due to the generality of RL, the prevalent trend in RL research is to develop agents that can efficiently learn tabula rasa, that is, from scratch without using previously learned knowledge about the problem.

Image quality assessment (IQA) uses models to build a bridge between an image and a user's subjective perception of its quality. In the deep learning era, many IQA approaches, such as NIMA, have achieved success by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based IQA models are often constrained by the fixed-size input requirement in batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized or cropped to a fixed size shape.
