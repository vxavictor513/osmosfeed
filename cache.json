          "description": ",\nRecently, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study tracking US federal agencies’ progress on meeting the requirements set out in OMB M-21-31. Released in 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)’s M-21-31 memorandum provided guidance and requirements for federal agencies in order to improve centralized visibility into logging data before, during, and after cybersecurity incidents. The memo outlined a logging maturity model with four tiers (E0-3) to guide agencies in their compliance process.\n\nIn the new study, GAO found that agencies “have made progress in preparing for and responding to cyber threats.” At the same time, however, the study noted that 20 of the 23 agencies did not meet M-21-31’s tier 3 advanced event logging (“advanced EL3”) August deadline for tracking, storing, and managing event logs.\n\nThe study highlighted three challenges agencies are facing as they work to meet M-21-31 event logging requirements: \n\n\nLack of staff\n\nEvent logging technical challenges\n\nLimitations in cyber event information sharing\n\n\nIn this post, we’ll walk through these challenges and share how we’ve seen federal customers address them using Elasticsearch®.\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

          "description": ",\nIn the absence of other observability signals, generally everything in your infrastructure (hardware, software, and services) emits log lines. Logs, however, are often structured at a developer’s whim and, first and foremost, serve the developer’s needs (e.g., debugging). Once in production, these same log lines are inherently promoted to a first-class means of observing your applications and infrastructure, regardless of their original intent. This makes logs a notoriously noisy observability signal whose rate can swing wildly with errors and scale.\n\nThe simplicity of the log line as an observability signal (fundamentally, it’s just text!) makes it deceivingly simple to observe. On the other hand, its noisy, unstructured nature and unpredictable rate make it among the most difficult of …",

          "description": "Why choose a Managed Service Provider (MSP)? ,\nUsing an MSP allows you to focus on your core business instead of your IT infrastructure. The right MSP not only provides deep technical expertise and 24/7 monitoring and management of your infrastructure, but it can also improve core operational and procedural challenges over time to help you reduce costs and streamline operations, so your IT team can focus on projects that accelerate your business.\nReady to engage with an Elastic Verified MSP?,\nWhether you want to leverage Elastic within your data center or via the cloud, here are eight areas to consider when selecting a MSP:\n\nSupport: Ensure that your preferred MSP offers 24/7 support and security operation center(s) across time zones.\n\nPricing: Review pricing models to make sure it fits within your resources.\n\nBreadth of services: Consider your needs today, but also what you might need in one, three, or five years. Choose an MSP with a wide range of services so you’re able to grow together and build a lasting partnership. \n\nCloud or hybrid posture: What is your current environment? Make sure your MSP supports your model.\n\nService offerings: Inquire about additional offerings, like consulting or migration services.\n\nReferences: Ask to see validated customer references and testimonials.\n\nCertifications and clearances: If your industry is regulated, ensure that your MSP has the right certifications and clearances. \n\nVerified: Consider choosing an MSP who is Elastic Verified. This ensures the MSP has the correct architecture design, proof of 24/7 support, Elastic-certified engineers, successful customer deployments, and more.\n\nOur current list of our Verified MSP partners includes:",

One of the current bottlenecks in video generation is in the ability to produce coherent large motions. In many cases, even the current leading models either generate small motion or, when producing larger motions, exhibit noticeable artifacts.\n \n\nTo explore the application of language models in video generation, we introduce VideoPoet, a large language model (LLM) that is capable of a wide variety of video generation tasks, including text-to-video, image-to-video, video stylization, video inpainting and outpainting, and video-to-audio. One notable observation is that the leading video gene…",

That’s how long it took to empty the Colosseum, an engineering marvel that’s still standing as the largest amphitheater in the world. Two thousand years later, this design continues to work well to move enormous crowds out of sporting and entertainment venues.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, exiting the arena is only the first step. Next, people must navigate the traffic that builds up in the surrounding streets. This is an age-old problem that remains unsolved to this day. In Rome, they addressed the issue by prohibiting private traffic on the street that passes directly by the Colosseum. This policy worked there, but what if you’re not in Rome?

These libraries provide high-level instructions to ML practitioners, such as linear algebra operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution, etc.) and neural network layers (e.g., 2D convolution layers, transformer layers).
