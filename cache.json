These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature.

Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.\nAgain, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments.

The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM.
