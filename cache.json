          "description": ",\nWhether referred to as “customer experience” or “citizen experience,” making sure people are satisfied with their digital interactions is a clear priority for the U.S. federal government. In September 2023, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), released the “Delivering a Digital First Public Experience” memorandum (OMB M-23-22). This document offers a policy framework for federal agencies as they continue to optimize online services and experiences. It also reflects growing citizen expectations for their digital interactions with the government.\nFrom a citizen’s perspective, digital experience is an area where the government has significant room for improvement. Only 8% of Americans say the U.S. government is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, according to Pew Research. And a McKinsey study found that the public sector is ranked lowest of 10 industries for customer satisfaction. Undoubtedly contributing to this dissatisfaction is the fact that private sector companies have set the digital bar so high. From online banking to one-click purchasing, frictionless digital interactions have become the norm for many citizens — and in many cases an expectation versus a “nice-to-have.”\nUnlike in many sectors, however, the consequences of a poor customer experience in the public sector can have ramifications beyond lost sales and revenue. The breadth of impact is significant: U.S. federal websites receive about 2 billion visits per month or almost 80 million hours of digital interactions with citizens. A suboptimal digital experience can mean that constituents don’t get access to critical support and services that affect their health and well-being. The U.S. government estimates that $140 billion in potential benefits go unused each year because of “outdated or complicated processes.”\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

          "description": ",\nAs the second largest and active Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, OpenTelemetry is well on its way to becoming the ubiquitous, unified standard and framework for observability. OpenTelemetry owes this success to its comprehensive and feature-rich toolset that allows users to retrieve valuable observability data from their applications with low effort. The OpenTelemetry Java agent is one of the most mature and feature-rich components in OpenTelemetry’s ecosystem. It provides automatic instrumentation for JVM-based applications and comes with a broad coverage of auto-instrumentation modules for popular Java-frameworks and libraries.\n\nThe original instrumentation approach used in the OpenTelemetry Java agent left the maintenance and development of auto-instrumentation modules subject to some restrictions. As part of our reinforced commitment to OpenTelemetry, Elastic® helps evolve and improve OpenTelemetry projects and components. Elastic’s contribution of the Elastic Common Schema to OpenTelemetry was an important step for the open-source community.

          "description": ",\nAsset tracking and management in the military is like playing a game of chess — you need to know where all your pieces are to make the right moves. Assets can be anything from troops, vehicles, IT equipment, or supplies, and having a way to visualize and track assets can improve the decisions made in tactical scenarios. \nReal-time situational awareness (RTSA) and asset tracking go hand in hand. Fast, accurate asset tracking can be enabled by RTSA capabilities such as monitoring, managing, and responding to dynamic situations (including real-time monitoring of data points), aggregating and analyzing large volumes of data, and integrating multiple streams into a common location for visualization and decision-making.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blta8550540dbe…",

These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature.

Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.\nAgain, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments.

Unlike robots and self-driving cars, people don't have any \"out-of-body\" sensors to help guide them. Instead, a person’s sensory input is completely \"egocentric\", or \"from the self.\" This also applies to new technologies that understand the world around us from a human-like perspective, e.g., robots navigating through unknown buildings, AR glasses that highlight objects, or assistive technology to help people run independently.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn computer vision, scene understanding is the subfield that studies how visible objects relate to the sce…",

For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. \n\n\n\nUsing methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons.
