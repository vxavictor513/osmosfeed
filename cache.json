The ICO work with businesses and public sector organisations to offer guidance and best practices for using data and information responsibly, as well as regulating and enforcing relevant laws. \nFor public sector organisations especially, operating in accordance with the ICO is essential in serving the public with integrity and finding the balance between data transparency and privacy.\nIn their strategic plan ICO25, the ICO lays out their objectives for the next three years: \n\nEmpowering people to confidently share their information to use the products and services that drive our economy and our society\n\nEmpowering organisations to use information responsibly and confidently to invest and innovate\n\nEmpowering people to hold government to account, driving transparency that helps us all better trust in the decisions taken by public bodies\n\nIn a free and open society, these are important principles for governing public bodies and their interaction with citizens. Adhering to these objectives, however, can place significant and additional burden on already stretched public sector resources and at a time when data control and access is so high profile and fraught with risk. What’s more, the ICO also has powers to apply monetary penalties for organisations  — 54 such incidents are listed on the ICO website for 2023 as of this writing.So how can private sector technology companies like Elastic® and our partners help you align with the ICO’s goals?\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

          "description": "Posted by Edith Cohen and Uri Stemmer, Research Scientists, Google Research\n\n\n\n\n\nDifferential privacy (DP) is a rigorous mathematical definition of privacy. DP algorithms are randomized to protect user data by ensuring that the probability of any particular output is nearly unchanged when a data point is added or removed. Therefore, the output of a DP algorithm does not disclose the presence of any one data point. There has been significant progress in both foundational research and adoption of differential privacy with contributions such as the Privacy Sandbox and Google Open Source Library.\n\n\nML and data analytics algorithms can often be described as performing multiple basic computation steps on the same dataset. When each such step is differentially private, so is the output, but with …",
