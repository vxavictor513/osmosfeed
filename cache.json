          "description": "Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! It’s 27 December as I write this and - being honest - I couldn’t be happier. It’s raining outside. I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going? My family and I had a lovely Chris…",

The release adds the following features:\n\r\n\r\n  \nWe introduced @ApplicationModuleListener to ease the declaration of asynchronous, transactional event listeners that run in a transaction themselves. A model that we recommend as default to integration application modules. (#80, reference documentation)\n\r\n  \nThe application module dependency structure is now also exposed as Spring Boot actuator. This allows operating infrastructure to visualize insights it provides to operations teams to be aligned with the application module structure (HTTP traces by module etc.) (#87, reference documentation\n\r\n  \nThe Postgres event publication registry schema now follows Postgres best practices. (#81)\n\r\n\r\nThe release also contains the obligatory upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0.1. Find more information on the release page.",

See my friends on the Spring team in person since the pandemic descended. And, I’m overjoyed to relate, I’ve just had the privilege of a nice meeting with several of them last night. And I’m going to see more of them today! Seriously. I feel like I won the lottery. I’ve missed my friends. Hug your friends and family, friends. You never know when the next pandemic (or life in general) will put distance between you and them. So, in order to close that distance, I’m going to go back to meetings with them, and I’ll leave you with yet another week’s curated list of content.

Your code sits on opened sockets and passes data from one end to the other. That's a great use case for an asynchronous application in Python, but it needs to be carefully crafted.\nWhen data flows through that pipeline, we want to ensure we don't blow the available resources (RAM/CPU/FDs).

The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated adoption of modern technologies and shined a light on the importance of patient experiences. As more consumers are taking control of their data, healthcare systems are getting stretched. According to a study published by Deloitte and the Scottsdale Institute, 92% of healthcare technology leaders see digital capabilities as a path to achieve better patient experience.\n\nIn this blog post, we’ll explore how Elastic’s search capabilities can help address potential barriers to health equity, as outlined in the Center for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) strategic pillars — specifically, how to deliver relevant results for healthcare i…",

This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.\nWhen we come across users that are experiencing performance problems, it is not uncommon that this can be traced back to issue…",

It enables users to sign project-based content (think playbooks, workflows, inventories, etc.) and verify whether or not that content has remained secure. It also features a new CLI tool, ansible-sign. This blog post will explain how it works, illustrate how to implement it, and highlight a few scenarios.",

In Kubernetes, scheduling gates\nare keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.\nWhat problem does it solve?\nWhen a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This\ninfinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.\nPods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)\nwaste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of\nthe Pod's scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the\nscheduler's performance.

          "description": "Posted by Alexis Morvan and Trond Andersen, Research Scientists, Google Quantum AI  \nWhen quantum computers were first proposed, they were hoped to be a way to better understand the quantum world. With a so-called “quantum simulator,” one could engineer a quantum computer to investigate how various quantum phenomena arise, including those that are intractable to simulate with a classical computer.  \n    \nBut making a useful quantum simulator has been a challenge. Until now, quantum simulations with superconducting qubits have predominantly been used to verify pre-existing theoretical predictions and have rarely explored or discovered new phenomena. Only a few experiments with trapped ions or cold atoms have revealed new insights. Superconducting qubits, even though they are one of the main…",

With increasing focus on online privacy, there’s an opportunity to identify ML algorithms that have better privacy-utility trade-offs. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a popular framework for developing ML algorithms responsibly with provable privacy guarantees.

How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label. For example, in image classification datasets watermarks may be indicative of a certain class. Or it can happen that all the pictures of dogs happen to be taken outside, against green grass, so a green background become…",
