The tool, which is available in Kibana®’s Machine Learning section, simplifies the task of identifying what contributes to unusual spikes or drops in log rates: Is the root cause a specific service in your stack? Is it limited to a particular region? Are there shared characteristics among log messages contributing to this change? Historically, addressing these investigations required SREs to dedicate hours manually comparing logs and metadata to determine whether the change in log rate represented a genuine issue and, if so, its root cause.

AI systems capable of such diagnostic dialogues could increase availability, accessibility, quality and consistency of care by being useful conversational partners to clinicians and patients alike. But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. \n\n\n\n\n\nRecent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations. However, there are many aspects of good diagnostic dialogue that are unique to the medical domain. …",

Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.\n\n\n\nThis has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…",
