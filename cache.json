Today’s cloud-based businesses deploy applications across various regions and even cloud providers. So, harnessing the power of metadata provided by the Elastic APM agents becomes more critical. Leveraging the metadata, including crucial information like cloud region, provider, and machine type, allows us to track costs across the application stack. In this blog post, we look at how we can use cloud metadata to empower businesses to make smarter and cost-effective decisions, all while improving resource utilization and the user experience.\n\nFirst, we need an example application that allows us to monitor infrastructure changes effectively.

          "description": ",\nIn 1991, a weather system formed off the east coast of the United States with a cold front that created a low pressure ridge to the east of Nova Scotia. At the same time, a high-pressure system extending out from the Appalachian Mountains forced the ridge first southeast and then to the west, where it encountered the remnants of Hurricane Grace, which it promptly absorbed and swelled in size as it did so. The resulting storm caused over $200 million of damage to the United States and was known as “The Perfect Storm,” later to be immortalized in a book of the same name. \n\nFor public sector organizations trying to deliver cybersecurity, a similar pattern is emerging — but perhaps with less visible effects. Disparate elements are combining with rapid intensity and have the potential to unleash a ferocious assault on the world’s cyber defenses.\nSecurity threats and citizen data,\nThirdly, given this proliferation of security threats and the need to protect citizen data, governments are likely to increase regulation and compliance requirements.

Many times we’ve come across people using task after task to manipulate data, to turn items into lists, filter our options, trying to do heavy data manipulation and to turn data from one source into another. Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own. While many of these options will work, they aren’t very efficient or easy to implement. Ansible Playbooks were never meant for programming.",

Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim\nadmission validation mechanism within\nthe API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.\nHow to use it?\nAs this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.\nSimply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.\nFor more details, read about\ndefault StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",
