          "description": ",\nAs some of you already noticed, Elasticsearch 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8 brought good indexing speedups across a wide range of data sets, from simple keywords to heavy KNN vectors, as well as ingest-pipeline-heavy ingestion workloads. Ingestion involves many components — running ingest pipelines, inverting data in memory, flushing segments, merging segments — and all of these usually take a non-negligible amount of time. Fortunately for you, we've made improvements across all of these areas, enabling faster speeds for end-to-end ingestion. \n\nAs an example, 8.8 is 13% faster than 8.6 at ingestion on our benchmark that simulates a realistic logging use-case with multiple data sets, ingest pipelines, etc. The following chart shows the ingestion rate going from ~22.5k docs/s to ~25.5k docs/s over the period of time when we implemented these optimizations.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt99f2525e6b30c673/649eece17c84d215bdc2ac35/elastic-blog-ingestion-speedups.png,elastic-blog-ingestion-speedups.png,\nThis blog dives into some of the changes that helped achieve ingestion speedups in 8.6, 8.7, and 8.8.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt512a0f1b39217f35/649ef4e0fa183536f118dccb/elastic-blog-total-ingest-pipline.png,elastic-blog-total-ingest-pipline.png,\nWe expect these speedups to be representative of the improvement that a non-trivial ingest use case would see after an upgrade to 8.7 or a more recent version.",

Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot). However, there is still a significant performance gap between these methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised VQA methods, such as MaMMU…",

Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging. For instance, when searching for a fashion item, users may want an item whose specific attribute, e.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website. Yet searching for the item in an existing search engine is not trivial since precisely describing the fashion item by text can be challenging. To address this fact, composed image retrieval (CIR…",

An important algorithmic piece of cache management is the decision policy used for dynamically updating the set of items being stored, which has been extensively optimized over several decades, resulting in several efficient and robust heuristics.
