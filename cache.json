We are committed to developing these open standards jointly. And today, we share that several more community-minded security technology vendors are contributing to this effort. Embracing the OTel Semantic Conventions framework helps users reduce the time and effort required for querying and correlating diverse data, building visualizations, and analyzing features for machine learning applications. Normalizing security and observability data with the OTel Semantic Conventions is a powerful tool that drastically reduces the complexity that so often hinders efficient analysis of software, performance, and security issues.\n\nSecurity teams and technology vendors alike are embracing open data standards to enable holistic analysis of diverse data. In fact, OTel is the second-highest velocity project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) because of its vendor agnostic framework.\n,The release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

          "description": ",\nAs a leader in Security Analytics, we at Elastic are often asked for our recommendations for architectures for long-term data analysis. And more often than not, the concept of Limitless Data is a novel idea. Other security analytics vendors, struggling to support long-term data retention and analysis, are perpetuating a myth that organizations have no option but to deploy a slow and unwieldy data lake (or swamp) to store data for long periods of time.\n\nLet’s bust this myth. In Elastic, limitless data isn’t a pipedream — it’s a reality. Thousands of our customers are already benefiting from a unified data layer that maintains months and years of actionable data in an affordable and rapidly accessible way. \nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt4409d53575fa7a08/64c…",

Many times we’ve come across people using task after task to manipulate data, to turn items into lists, filter our options, trying to do heavy data manipulation and to turn data from one source into another. Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own. While many of these options will work, they aren’t very efficient or easy to implement. Ansible Playbooks were never meant for programming.",

While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.\n\n\nAdaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons.
