But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. \n\n\n\n\n\nRecent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations.

Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.\n\n\n\nThis has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…",

Next, people must navigate the traffic that builds up in the surrounding streets. This is an age-old problem that remains unsolved to this day.
