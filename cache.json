Never taking lessons, she learned through YouTube videos and a lot of practice. \n\n“I don’t mind struggling at something,” she says. “I was very, very bad at guitar at the beginning, and then one day I wasn’t bad anymore.”\n\nFollowing her interest in music, Stephanie decided to pursue a career as a musician, so she…",

Embracing the OTel Semantic Conventions framework helps users reduce the time and effort required for querying and correlating diverse data, building visualizations, and analyzing features for machine learning applications. Normalizing security and observability data with the OTel Semantic Conventions is a powerful tool that drastically reduces the complexity that so often hinders efficient analysis of software, performance, and security issues.\n\nSecurity teams and technology vendors alike are embracing open data standards to enable holistic analysis of diverse data.

Logstash® on Kubernetes integrates with the rest of the Elastic Stack on ECK and removes the need to manage all the resources individually and manually. \n\nThe Logstash operator allows you to manage and configure Logstash pods in just a few lines of YAML with support for configuring Logstash pipelines using the familiar Logstash Domain Specific Language (DSL) inline in the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) or in mounted volumes. Multiple pipelines and pipeline->pipeline configurations are fully supported, and any updated pipelines will be detected and reloaded inside the pod, without requiring a restart of the pod.\n\nThe technical preview includes streamline…",

Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own.

A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows.

While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.\n\n\nAdaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…",
