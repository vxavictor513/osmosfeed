NLP opens up opportunities to extract information, classify text, and provide better search relevance through dense vectors and approximate nearest neighbor search.\nIn this multi-part blog series, we will walk through end-to-end examples using a variety of PyTorch NLP models.\nPart 1: How to deploy text embeddings and vector search\nPart 2: Named entity recognition (NER)\nPart 3: Sentiment analysis\nIn each example we will use a prebuilt NLP model from the Hugging Face model hub. Then we will follow the Elastic documented instructions for deploying an NLP model and adding NLP inference to an ingest pipeline.  Because it’s always a good idea to start with a defined use case and an understanding of the text data to process in the model, we’ll start by defining the objective for using NLP and a shared data set for anyone to try out.\nTo prepare for the NLP example, we will need an Elasticsearch cluster running at least version 8.0, an ML node with at least 2GB RAM, and for the named entity recognition (NER) example we’ll use the required mapper-annotated-text plugin. One of the easiest ways to get started is by following along with these NLP examples with your own free 14-day trial cluster on Elastic Cloud. Cloud trials are able to scale to a max of two 2GB ML nodes, which will allow you to deploy one or two of examples at any one time in this multi-part blog series.",

There is typically a probability score for that prediction between 0 and 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating more-confident predictions. This type of NLP analysis can be usefully applied to many data sets such as product reviews or customer feedback.\nThe c…",

We will then show how to use those embeddings in the vector similarity search to find semantically similar documents for a given query.\nVector similarity search or, as is commonly called semantic search, goes beyond the traditional keyword based search and allows users to find semantically similar documents that may not have any common keywords thus providing a wider range of results.

In this research piece, we explore BPFDoor — a backdoor payload specifically crafted for Linux in order to gain re-entry into a previously or actively compromised target environment. This payload has been observed across systems for five years, suggesting that the threat actors responsible for operating the malware have been around for some time and have likely operated undetected in many environments. \nThe threat actors have leveraged a network of VPS servers to act as a controller and access these systems via compromised routers based out of Taiwan, acting as a VPN network for the adversarial group. In the Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team’s deep research, we explore the actual payload, the backdoor lifecycle, and the BPF filters that are leveraged to provide you with insights on how evasion occurs within impacted systems. \nIt’s important to know how you can detect this payload threat and understand the sophistication of the loader. Both are covered in this research. The Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team also shares the actual indicators of compromise.\nIt’s critical to invest the time and resources into ensuring your organization’s workloads remain effectively monitored.
