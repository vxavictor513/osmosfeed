A significant challenge in this realm is the management of disparate software solutions from multiple vendors.

Logs, however, are often structured at a developer’s whim and, first and foremost, serve the developer’s needs (e.g., debugging). Once in production, these same log lines are inherently promoted to a first-class means of observing your applications and infrastructure, regardless of their original intent. This makes logs a notoriously noisy observability signal whose rate can swing wildly with errors and scale.\n\nThe simplicity of the log line as an observability signal (fundamentally, it’s just text!) makes it deceivingly simple to observe.

AI systems capable of such diagnostic dialogues could increase availability, accessibility, quality and consistency of care by being useful conversational partners to clinicians and patients alike. But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. \n\n\n\n\n\nRecent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations.

Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.\n\n\n\nThis has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…",

That’s how long it took to empty the Colosseum, an engineering marvel that’s still standing as the largest amphitheater in the world. Two thousand years later, this design continues to work well to move enormous crowds out of sporting and entertainment venues.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut of course, exiting the arena is only the first step. Next, people must navigate the traffic that builds up in the surrounding streets. This is an age-old problem that remains unsolved to this day. In Rome, they addressed the issue by prohibiting private traffic on the street that passes directly by the Colosseum. This policy worked there, but what if you’re not in Rome? What if you’re at the Superbowl? Or at a Taylor Swift concert?\n\n…",
