They started as organic Slack channels that Elasticians could join to connect with others from similar backgrounds or experiences. \nIn 2021, we formalized these ERGs to ensure that the members would have structure, budget, and ultimately, a voice based on any dimension of diversity, allyship, and advocacy. Formalizing these ERGs was an important step in broadening the impact of our collective diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI) initiatives. \nERGs are aligned to shared identities, interests, affinities, or allyships and have visions and goals they are working towards.

We recommend 7.17.1 over the previous patch versions in 7.17.x.\n\nThe 7.17.1 patch release contains a fix for a potential security vulnerability. Please see our security advisory for more details.\n\nThis version also contains fixes for a number of problems in the 7.17 to 8.x upgrade experience, and we strongly recommend anyone upgrading to 8.x should upgrade to this version, 7.17.1, *before* running the upgrade assistant. If not, you could encounter one of the known pre-upgrade migration problems that are fixed in 7.17.1. These fixed problems include the following, although there are others:\n\nNodes would not start up if shut down part way through system index migration.\nSystem index migration might not run if it had previously suffered from errors.\nMigration of the internal .tasks index would fail if it was originally created in 6.x.\n\n\nFor full details of the issues that have been fixed in this version, please see the release notes.\nFor a full list of changes for each product, please refer to the release notes:\n7.17.1 Release Notes\nElastic Stack\n\nElasticsearch\nKibana\nBeats\nLogstash\n\nElastic Enterprise Search\n\nEnterprise Search\n\nElastic Observability\n\nAPM\n\nElastic Security\n\nElastic Security Solution",

We’d like robots to do the same, i.e., to learn new skills by watching people do things during training. Today, however, the predominant paradigm for teaching robots is to remote control them using specialized hardware for teleoperation and then train them to imitate pre-recorded demonstrations. This limits both who can provide the demonstrations (programmers & roboticists) and where they can be provided (lab settings). If robots could instead self-learn new tasks by watching humans, this capability could allow them to be deployed in more unstructured settings like the home, and ma…",

Jouppi, Google Fellow, Google Research    \nContinuing advances in the design and implementation of datacenter (DC) accelerators for machine learning (ML), such as TPUs and GPUs, have been critical for powering modern ML models and applications at scale. These improved accelerators exhibit peak performance (e.g., FLOPs) that is orders of magnitude better than traditional computing systems. However, there is a fast-widening gap between the available peak performance offered by state-of-the-art hardware and the actual achieved performance when ML models run on that hardware.  \n One approach to address this gap is to design hardware-specific ML models that optimize both performance (e.g., throughput and latency) and model quality.

One of the grand challenges in robotics is to successfully train robots to do the same, i.e., to develop a general-purpose robot capable of performing a multitude of tasks based on arbitrary user commands. Robots that are faced with the real world will also inevitably encounter new user instructions and situations that were not seen during training. Therefore, it is imperative for robots to be trained to perform multiple tasks in a variety of situations and, more importantly, to be capable of solving new tasks as requested by human users, even if the robot was not explicitly trained on those t…",

However, despite aggregating large amounts of data, in theory it is possible for models to encode characteristics of individual entries from the training set.  For example, experiments in controlled settings have shown that language models trained using email datasets may sometimes encode sensitive information included in the training data and may have the potential to reveal the presence of a particular user’s data in the training set.
