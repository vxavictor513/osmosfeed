Spring community members across the globe, like you, shared their views and experiences, and it all made for fantastic reading.\n\r\nThe survey is back this year, and we want to hear from you! How can Spring help you build new apps and experiences this year? What would you like us to change? This year, we have new sections on Spring Native, building & sharing APIs internally/externally, and a deeper dive on Data.\n\r\nIn exchange for 15 minutes of your time taking the survey, you’ll be among the first to receive our report and the insights included in it. \n\r\nSounds good? Head over to spring.io/survey now!

Want to count how many log messages contain access denied in the last 24 hours? Elasticsearch can give you the answer in milliseconds thanks to its index structures — but index structures take CPU time to build and need disk space.
