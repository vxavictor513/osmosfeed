          "description": ",\nEffective November 1, 2022 Elastic is making changes to Elastic Cloud pricing to simplify and bring parity across Direct and Marketplace prices. Moving forward, customers will pay the same price for Elastic Cloud whether they purchase directly from Elastic or through their preferred Cloud Service Provider’s marketplace. Thanks to our close partnership with the cloud providers over the last few years, we've significantly reduced the marketplace fees our customers have been paying and are now able to align pricing across all purchasing avenues.\n\nMany customers prefer to use their pre-committed cloud marketplace spend to purchase software as it helps shorten the purchase cycle and accelerate onboarding. With this change, when customers purchase an Elastic subscription using their pre-committed cloud provider marketplace spend, they will pay the same price they would pay Elastic directly.\n\nAs a result of this change, some customers will see a small price decrease, while others may see slightly higher prices (up to 4%), but many will see little or no change. Elastic has directly communicated with all impacted customers. The price change for impacted customers will be reflected in the November billing statement made available in December 2022.\n\nIn addition, to help customers optimize their Elastic deployment and reduce costs, we’ve added a number of features. These include simple, no-downtime migration capability to help users adopt the most price-performant instance type for their use case, as well as Searchable Snapshots, which enables users to leverage cost-effective cloud-based object storage. Please see our blog post, Top 5 ways to optimize your Elastic Cloud costs. \n\nWe encourage you to reach out to your account team if you have questions. If you are unsure who your account representative is, you can Contact Elastic. For information on Elastic pricing, you can visit our pricing page.",

We focus on the impact of search-powered technologies to help businesses achieve the outcomes they expect from cloud-driven digital transformation.\n\n“Almost 90% of all the data that matters to any given enterprise is unstructured, according to IDC,” writes Rick Laner, Elastic’s Chief Customer Officer and the guest editor of this debut issue.\n\n“Thinking about the hundreds of technology leaders that I’ve advised, that means that without the right processes and technology, they’d only have a view into 10% of their company,” he writes. “No one can make smart decisions that way.”\n\nSearch-powered technologies enable the search of data across multiple sources such as websites, applications, databases, and hybrid cloud environments, according to a study conducted by Forrester Consulting, commissioned by Elastic. \n\nContributor and noted tech writer Rusty Weston highlights the impact of search-powered technology in our feature article. Additional articles featuring advice and interviews from our expert contributor network cover digital transformation, customer experience, cybersecurity, and observability challenges that digital business leaders have faced and overcome. \n\nElastic Insights will be published quarterly, encompassing the latest research and insights that Elastic’s partners, customers, and Elasticians have to offer.

          "description": "When we manage a large number of virtual machines (VMs), we want to reduce the differences between them and create a standard template. By using a standard template, it becomes easier to manage and propagate the same operation on the different nodes. When using VMware vSphere, it is a common practice to share a standardized VM template and use it to create new VMs. This template is often called a golden image. Its creation involves a series of steps that can be automated with Ansible. In this blog, we will see how one can create and use a new golden image.",

Consistency is also a principle found within Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. With only a few lines of YAML-formatted manifests, thousands of instances can be set up and configured uniformly. While the management of target instances is simple, it is the control node, or where the Ansible execution is initiated, that can  be the most challenging aspect. As Ansible is written in Python, does the machine have the correct version of Python installed?  Are the necessary Python modules installed? Are there any operating system dependencies needed?

          "description": "Posted by Yilin Wang, Staff Software Engineer, YouTube and Feng Yang, Senior Staff Software Engineer, Google Research \nOnline video sharing platforms, like YouTube, need to understand perceptual video quality (i.e., a user's subjective perception of video quality) in order to better optimize and improve user experience. Video quality assessment (VQA) attempts to build a bridge between video signals and perceptual quality by using objective mathematical models to approximate the subjective opinions of users. Traditional video quality metrics, like peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and Video Multi-Method Assessment Fusion (VMAF), are reference-based and focus on the relative difference between the target and reference videos. Such metrics, which work best on professionally generated content …",

Internally, we regularly use Google Vizier as the default platform for hyperparameter optimization.

However, robotic systems today are capable of executing only very short, hard-coded commands, such as “Pick up an apple,” because they tend to perform best with clear tasks and rewards. They struggle with learning to perform long-horizon tasks and reasoning about abstract goals, such as a user prompt like “I just worked out, can you get me a healthy snack?” \nMeanwhile, recent progress in training language models (LMs) has led to systems that can perform a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks with impressive results.

As such, researchers often utilize learning-to-rank (LTR), a set of supervised machine learning techniques that optimize for the utility of an entire list of items (rather than a single item at a time). A noticeable recent focus is on combining LTR with deep learning. Existing libraries, most notably TF-Ranking, offer researchers and practitioners the necessary tools to use LTR in their work.
