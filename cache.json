Many traditional threat detection and response strategies rely on homogeneous environments, system baselines, and consistent control implementations. These strategies have been built on traditional environment assumptions that may no longer be true in your environment with the evolution of cloud computing, remote work, and modern culture.\nElastic is distributed by design, from our technology to our workforce. Elasticians are empowered to work where they want, when they want, how they want. This includes what technologies they utilize, what configurations they need, and what software they prefer.
