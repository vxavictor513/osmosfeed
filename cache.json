Originating from the Indian subcontinent, this story tells of six blindfolded individuals who encounter an elephant for the first time. Each individual touches a different part of the elephant â its side, tusk, trunk, knee, ear, and tail â and subsequently forms a distinct and limited understanding of what the elephant might be. The individual who feels the side believes the elephant to be a wall, the one who touches the tusk thinks it's a spear, and so forth. Subsequently, they argue fiercely, each convinced that their perception of the elephant is the whole truth.Â \nhttps://static-www.elaâ¦",
