          "description": "Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.\r\nThe release is packed with improvements.\r\nWe have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.\r\nThe most notable changes are:\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFind a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.",

In contrast to that, upgrading to a new minor or even a new major version requires more work, including code changes to adapt to new or changed APIs, updating configurations to not use deprecated keys anymore, and more.\n\r\nEach new minor or major version of Spring therefore ships with a comprehensive guide and documentation about those changes and you can read and follow to upgrade your project.

I love PostgreSQL. But then he goes even further, turning the mechanism into support in Spring Integration. He explains everything in this epic post, Using Postgres as a Message Queue\n\r\n  \nCreate a new Git branch with no history - not strictly speaking Spring-related, but I thought it was interesting. Unless you’re not using Git… I suppose.\n\r\n  \nNonUniqueResultException in Spring Data JPA\n\r\n  \nObservability with Spring Boot 3\n\r\n  \nOddity with shutdown methods in Spring Boot 3 AOT and GraalVM\n\r\n  \nSpring Boot (3) Spring Native (GraalVM) with Kubernetes & Istio🔥\n\r\n  \nUsing Watermarks with iText in Java\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes 1.26: Job Tracking, to Support Massively Parallel Batch Workloads, Is Generally Available\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes v1.26: Advancements in Kubernetes Traffic Engineering\n\r\n  \nBlog: Kubernetes v1.26: Alpha support for cross-namespace storage data sources",

I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going?

While the pillars are valuable for observability, they are not enough on their own.    \n\nIn this blog post, we will discuss why continuous profiling signals are a must-have in your observability toolbox, and how they complement metrics, logs, and traces.

For example, a website or a web service gets HTTP requests and sends back responses in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.). For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.\nThe structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.\nThere are a few considerations to make such an application work wel…",

Companies that are distributed have an ethos that where you do your work doesn’t impact your performance. Working remotely is at the individual level.

Following security best practices when developing and configuring microservices do not result in non-vulnerable microservices.

It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here \"Security-Behavior Analysis\", can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices.
