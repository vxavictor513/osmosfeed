          "description": ",\nAt Elastic, we strive to stay on top of the needs of our customers and solutions. One of the most common questions we receive is how to manage not only ever-increasing data volumes, but also higher shard counts. This is a complex problem that requires keeping resource usage (memory, CPU, and disk) under control while ensuring optimal performance.\n\nWe’ve already talked about scalability improvements for Elasticsearch 7.16, but for Elasticsearch 8 we have taken the effort to the next level!\n\nIn this article, we will talk about the steps we took and the methodology we developed to ensure that the improvements in areas like indexing, cluster state size, field caps latency, and snapshots result in an overall better experience with Elasticsearch 8.\nNightly benchmarks\nHistorically at Elastic, w…",

Below, we'll walk through what you need to do to expand your deployment so you can start gathering metrics from application performance monitoring (APM) or \"tracing\" data in your observability cluster, for free.\nWhat is APM?\nApplication performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.\n\nIn addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:\n\nWhether you're setting up alerts for SLA breaches, trying to gauge the impact of …",

          "description": "Posted by Matthew Streeter, Software Engineer, Google Research\n\n\n\n\nDerivatives play a central role in optimization and machine learning. By locally approximating a training loss, derivatives guide an optimizer toward lower values of the loss. Automatic differentiation frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are an essential part of modern machine learning, making it feasible to use gradient-based optimizers to train very complex models.\n\n\n \n\n\nBut are derivatives all we need? By themselves, derivatives only tell us how a function behaves on an infinitesimal scale. To use derivatives effectively, we often need to know more than that. For example, to choose a learning rate for gradient descent, we need to know something about how the loss function behaves over a small but finite windo…",

Being able to measure and estimate the biological signatures of aging can help researchers identify preventive measures to reduce disease risk and impact. Researchers have developed “aging clocks” based on markers such as blood proteins or DNA methylation to measure individuals’ biological age, which is distinct from one’s chronological age.
