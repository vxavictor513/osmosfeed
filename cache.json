Thanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests.\nEnd of life\n\r\nIt’s just over a year since the release of Spring Boot 2.6.0 which means that, as per our open source support policy, 2.6.14 is the last release that’s planned in the 2.6.x line. Releases may be made in the future, but only in response to a commercial support request.\n\r\nAs previously announced, Spring Boot 2.7 will be the last minor in the 2.x line. As such, we’ve extended our open source support for 2.7.x release by an additional 6 months until November 2023. In addition, commercial support for Spring Boot 2.7 has also been extended and is available until February 2025.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you’re interested in helping out, check out the “ideal for contribution” tag in the issue repository.

With a so-called “quantum simulator,” one could engineer a quantum computer to investigate how various quantum phenomena arise, including those that are intractable to simulate with a classical computer.  \n    \nBut making a useful quantum simulator has been a challenge.

How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label.

For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale. However, one of the challenges of continued scaling is that training new, larger models requires great amounts of computational resources.
