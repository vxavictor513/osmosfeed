These quantum computers will be much bigger than today, consisting of millions of coherent quantum bits, or qubits. But thereâs a catch â these basic building blocks must be good enough or the systems will be overrun with errors. \n\nCurrently, the error rates of the qubits on our 3rd generation Sycamore processor are typically between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100.
