When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected. It can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary as we saw in the 2020 SUNBURST supply chain compromise. Could we then have detected SUNBURST in the initial hours or days by finding its C2 beacon?\nThe potential for beaconing detection is that it can serve as an early warning system and help discover novel persistence mechanisms in the initial hours or days after execution.

          "description": ",\nWe are thrilled to announce the first release candidate of 8.0.0 after the last beta release. Again, we want to remind you that this is not for production use. There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-rc1 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).\nWe’d love to get your feedback and tips on any bugs you find through our Pioneer Program. To become an Elastic Pioneer, try out the preview of any (preferably, every) part of the Elastic Stack and open issues as you find them in the appropriate repo — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and APM. When you open an issue, mention that you found the bug in 8.0.0-rc1, and we’ll add a “Pioneer Program” label.\nIf you have questions about preparing for your upgrade to 8.0, visit our forums or community Slack channel, and we’d be happy to help!\n\nTry it out\nAnd now, without further ado, we bring to you 8.0.0-rc1. Happy downloading. Go forth, and explore.\nElastic Stack\n\nElasticsearch: download and release notes\nKibana: download and release notes\nBeats: downloads and release notes\nAgent: download\nLogstash: download and release notes\nES-Hadoop: download and release notes\n\nElastic Enterprise Search\n\nEnterprise Search: download and release notes\n\nElastic Observability\n\nAPM Server: download and release notes\n\nElastic Security\n\nSecurity: release notes",

One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost increase…",

With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. \nHowever, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements.

Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we'll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact.
