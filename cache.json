I love PostgreSQL. But then he goes even further, turning the mechanism into support in Spring Integration. He explains everything in this epic post, Using Postgres as a Message Queue\n\r\n  \nCreate a new Git branch with no history - not strictly speaking Spring-related, but I thought it was interesting.

I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked! \n\r\nHow were or are your holidays going? My family and I had a lovely Chris…",

A model that we recommend as default to integration application modules. (#80, reference documentation)\n\r\n  \nThe application module dependency structure is now also exposed as Spring Boot actuator. This allows operating infrastructure to visualize insights it provides to operations teams to be aligned with the application module structure (HTTP traces by module etc.) (#87, reference documentation\n\r\n  \nThe Postgres event publication registry schema now follows Postgres best practices. (#81)\n\r\n\r\nThe release also contains the obligatory upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0.1. Find more information on the release page.",

In Kubernetes, scheduling gates\nare keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.\nWhat problem does it solve?\nWhen a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This\ninfinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.\nPods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)\nwaste scheduling cycles.

DP quantifies the “privacy cost” of an algorithm, i.e., the level of guarantee that the algorithm’s output distribution for a given dataset will not change significantly if a single user’s data is added to or removed from it. The algorithm is characterized by two parameters, ε and δ, where smaller values of both indicate “more private”.
