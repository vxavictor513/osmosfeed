          "description": "Our journey of improving performance is not complete without diving into the path events follow toward their destination. When Filebeat or any other beat is publishing events to a remote Elasticsearch®, it relies on its _bulk API. This means that Beats doesn’t only make requests to Elasticsearch, but it also parses its responses, which increases the memory utilization as a result. \n\nPreviously, we showed how we managed to reduce Beats allocation by reducing the use of Logger in the event’s hot path, which reduced the overall allocated memory.\n\nIn this post, we will dive into the path of the publishing method and discuss how we managed to improve the memory allocation, which results in a direct increase of speed.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blta44802b59581cce…",
