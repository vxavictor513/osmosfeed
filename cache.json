So, who comes out on top when investing in search and logging solutions? Elasticsearch® surpasses OpenSearch in cost efficiency.\n\nHow? OpenSearch is a forked search project based on old versions (7.10) of Elasticsearch and Kibana®. Through comprehensive tests, TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group validated that Elasticsearch outperforms OpenSearch across key performance indicators and resource utilization. Based on this technical validation, Elastic® developed a complementary report to provide a framework for buyers to understand the financial value their organization can reap when migrating from Opensearch to Elasticsearch for search and logging.\n\nWhether it is improving resource optimization, faster performance, IT efficiency, or license cost savings, the Elasticsearch Service Enterprise license tier has much more to offer than the OpenSearch Service.\nThe release and timing of any features or functionality described in this post remain at Elastic's sole discretion.

To answer that, let's put the spotlight on SIG\nCloud Provider.\nSIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud\nproviders. Their mission? Keeping the Kubernetes ecosystem fair and open for all. By setting clear\nstandards and requirements, they ensure every cloud provider plays nicely with Kubernetes. It is\ntheir responsibility to configure cluster components to enable cloud provider integrations.\nIn this blog of the SIG Spotlight series, Arujjwal Negi interviews\nMichael McCune (Re…",

As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations.
