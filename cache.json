We want to avoid confusing versioning when spring-shell upgrades and baselines with Spring Boot 3.x.

M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.\n\r\nIf you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.\n\r\nWe’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.\n\r\nPlease see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.\n\r\nIf you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.\nThanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests. \nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you’re interested in helping out, check out the “ideal for contribution” tag in the issue repository.

Recently, the Elastic Security team identified an unpatched Windows flaw in the Windows Protected Process Light (PPL) mechanism that lets malware disable security products, and incorporated a fix into Elastic Security to protect our users. \nIn our full analysis, the team summarizes what Windows protected anti-malware services include, and how both sandboxing and access tokens can operate in a Windows environment. The author, Gabriel Landau, provides detailed insight into the way tokens can be leveraged by hackers to penetrate and evade Windows-based systems. The article also includes a recorded demonstration showing exactly how sandboxing can quietly incapacitate anti-malware products. \nLandau’s analysis also goes into depth about how anti-malware vendors can defend themselves  against this exposure with an obscure Windows feature called trusted labels. \nTo find threats like malware and ransomware in your environment, install the latest version of Elastic Security, and be sure to take advantage of our quick start training to set yourself up for success. \nIf you’re new to Elastic Cloud, you can always get started for free with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud or download the self-managed version of the Elastic Stack for free.\nHappy hunting!",

One of the grand challenges in robotics is to successfully train robots to do the same, i.e., to develop a general-purpose robot capable of performing a multitude of tasks based on arbitrary user commands. Robots that are faced with the real world will also inevitably encounter new user instructions and situations that were not seen during training. Therefore, it is imperative for robots to be trained to perform multiple tasks in a variety of situations and, more importantly, to be capable of solving new tasks as requested by human users, even if the robot was not explicitly trained on those t…",

However, despite aggregating large amounts of data, in theory it is possible for models to encode characteristics of individual entries from the training set.

Arik, Research Scientist, Google Research, Cloud AI Team  \nDeep neural networks (DNNs) provide more accurate results as the size and coverage of their training data increases. While investing in high-quality and large-scale labeled datasets is one path to model improvement, another is leveraging prior knowledge, concisely referred to as “rules” — reasoning heuristics, equations, associative logic, or constraints. Consider a common example from physics where a model is given the task of predicting the next state in a double pendulum system. While the model may learn to estimate the total energy of the system at a given point in time only from empirical data, it will frequently overestimate the energy unless also provided an equation th…",

One major contributing factor is access to abundant labeled datasets, which are used to train highly effective supervised deep learning models. However, in the real-world, these models may encounter samples exhibiting rare conditions that are individually too infrequent for per-condition classification.

This technique has been traditionally used in the filmmaking and photography industry for image and video editing purposes, e.g., background replacement, synthetic bokeh and other visual effects. Image matting assumes that an image is a composite of foreground and background images, and hence, the intensity of each pixel is a linear combination of the foreground and the background.  \n   \nIn the case of traditional image segmentation, the image is segmented in a binary manner, in which a pixel either belongs to the foreground or background.

Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and forest health — for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, that means there’s a lot of dead wood. Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear. In fact, experts may identify up to 10x as many birds by ear as by sight. \nIn recent years, autonomous recording units (ARUs) have made it easy to capture thousands of hours of audio in forests that could be used to better understand ecosystems and identify critical habitat.
