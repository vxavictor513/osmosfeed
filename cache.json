          "description": "Dear Spring community,\n\r\nIt is my pleasure to announce that the first Spring Framework 6.0 milestone release is available from htts://repo.spring.io/milestone now. This initial milestone covers our baseline upgrade efforts, in particular requiring JDK 17+ and migrating to the Jakarta EE 9 APIs; see my recent baseline blog post for the rationale. At the same time, it removes many long-deprecated classes, including several support packages for outdated third-party infrastructure.\n\r\nFor current upgrade notes, please refer to our Upgrading to Spring Framework 6.0 page which we will keep updating. Follow our main branch on GitHub for the latest changes, as we prepare for 6.0 M2 and the corresponding Spring Boot 3.0 M1 release in January. At that point, you will also be able to consume Spring Framework 6.0 through https://start.spring.io/. For the time being, feel free to grab 6.0 M1 from https://repo.spring.io/ and let us know how it goes.\n\r\nCheers,\nJuergen",

          "description": ",\nCIOs are remaking the IT function — no longer will security and developer teams be siloed. \nRecent survey data from 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence, and published by Elastic shows a major shift in who is using application security tools, suggesting that DevSecOps is not just an idea, but a growing reality for IT decision makers.\nIT decision-makers allocated application security tools to 48% of development teams in 2020, compared to just 29% in 2015. That’s nearly a two-fold jump. \nAccording to “The New Security Imperative for CIOs” report by 451 Research, “Opportunities abound for security to become more directly integrated into DevOps efforts, with CIOs leading the charge.” The report continues: “Security teams must become better versed in DevOps practices and tools…",

Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  \n However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…",

However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective.
