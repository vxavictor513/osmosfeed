The case for AIOps is especially crucial given the expansive nature of today’s observability efforts across hybrid and multi-cloud environments. As with most observability platforms, it all starts with your telemetry data: metrics, logs, traces, and events. \n\nOnce IT operations teams collect and begin analyzing that data, the benefit of AIOps becomes rapidly clear.

By using a standard template, it becomes easier to manage and propagate the same operation on the different nodes. When using VMware vSphere, it is a common practice to share a standardized VM template and use it to create new VMs. This template is often called a golden image. Its creation involves a series of steps that can be automated with Ansible. In this blog, we will see how one can create and use a new golden image.",
