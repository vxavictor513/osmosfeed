Sadly, in some organizations true collaboration is rare and we still have a way to go to build effective DevOps partnerships.\nOutside of cultural challenges, one of the most common reasons for this disconnect is using different tools to achieve similar goals — case in point, end-to-end testing versus synthetic monitoring.

          "description": ",\nArtificial intelligence for IT Operations (or AIOps) has been playing an expanding role in helping SREs, DevOps, and developers effectively navigate the challenges around application and infrastructure complexity, pace of change, and data volume that characterize the operations landscape. By improving efficiency and effectiveness of application and infrastructure monitoring by automating many of the tasks, AIOps can help to reduce the workload on observability teams and free up time to spend on more meaningful analysis.\n\nIn our first post, What is AIOps? A beginner’s guide, we dove into AIOps: what it is, why it matters, and establishing production readiness. We talked about why it’s important for an AIOps initiative to start simple with time tested and proven AIOps capabilities, and the…",

The ability to reason on new tasks is mostly credited to training models on a wide variety of unique instructions, known as “instruction tuning”, which was introduced by FLAN and extended in T0, Super-Natural Instructions, MetaICL, and InstructGPT. However, much of the data that drives these advances remain unreleased to the broader research community. \n    \nIn “The Flan Collection: Designing Data and Methods for Effective Instruction Tuning”, we closely examine and release a newer and more extensive publicly ava…",

Consider, for instance, the example of a navigation app that responds to driver requests. In such settings there is inherent uncertainty about important aspects of the problem. For example, the preferences of the driver with respect to features of the route are often unknown and the delays of road segments can be uncertain.

However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts. For example, a doctor might write in their clinical notes, “pt referred to pt for lbp“, which is meant to convey the statement: “Patient referred to physical therapy for low back pain.”  Coming up with this translation is tough for laypeople and compu…",
