These capabilities will help our users get more out of their deployments and are part of multiple efforts underway to make our cloud offering more fully managed and easier to operate. Headquartered out of Ramat Gan, Israel, the company has developed a collection of products that thousands of DevOps and engineering teams use every day to take charge of their search operations. \n\nOpster is the creator of AutoOps, a powerful platform for Elasticse…",

These modifications inevitably lead to changes in the configuration of both applications and infrastructure. While some of these changes may be benign, others can unintentionally steer the systems away from their securely configured state, a phenomenon commonly referred to as \"configuration drift.\" Left unaddressed, the extent of this drift can introduce substantial risks to the organization.",

The following are some of the deprecations and removals coming in the Kubernetes 1.29 release.\nThe Kubernetes API removal and deprecation process\nThe Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level.

The points made there are totally valid – it doesn’t make much sense to pay for compute power that will not be used due to limits, nor to artificially increase latency. This post strives to argue that limits have their legitimate use as well.\nAs a Site Reliability Engineer on the Grafana Labs platform team, which maintains and improves internal infrastructure and tooling used by the product teams, I primarily try to make Kubernetes upgrades as smooth as possible.

However, because of uncertainties about processes that are small in scale yet globally important, such as clouds and ocean turbulence, these models’ predictions of upcoming climate changes are not very accurate in detail. For example, predictions of the time by which the global mean surface temperature of Earth will have warmed 2℃, relative to preindustrial times, vary by 40–50 years (a full human generation) among today’s models. As a result, we do not have the accurate and geographically granular predictions we need to plan resilient infrastructure, adapt supply chains to climate disruption, and assess the risks of…",
