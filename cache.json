What can happen on those 64 squares can be a disastrous adventure or a wonderful experience. Lichess is a platform that allows you to play chess; luckily for us, it publishes all rated games as archives, starting in 2013. There are a total of over 4 billion games played. Yes, 4 billion matches.\n\nIngesting 4 billion documents is something that the Elastic Stack can handle easily. However, my custom Python implementation to extract and ship those documents out of Lichess faced severe performance problems. We will use Elastic APM and Universal Profiling to solve those performance problems in my custom Python application.\n\nLet me start by saying that Elastic is an incredibly collaborative workplace.
