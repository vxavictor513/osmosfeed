          "description": ",\nAs more organizations leverage the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform and services to drive operational efficiency and bring products to market, managing logs becomes a critical component of maintaining visibility and safeguarding multi-account AWS environments. Traditionally, logs are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and then shipped to an external monitoring and analysis solution for further processing.\n\nTo simplify this process and reduce management overhead, AWS users can now leverage the new Amazon Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream to ingest logs into Elastic Cloud in AWS in real time and view them in the Elastic Stack alongside other logs for centralized analytics. This eliminates the necessity for time-consuming and expensive procedures such as VM provision…",

Admittingly, back then my focus was solely on figuring out how to best demonstrate to my customers the power of having a OpenStack private cloud. Anyone who has ever stood up or experimented with OpenStack knows that this is a tall order. Imagine having to stand up that platform over and over again on a daily basis. My focus was to find a way—a tool—that could help me do that, so I could focus on helping solve the customers' true challenges. Fast forward to now, and the decision to do it with Ansible still stands as the best choice hands down.",

The highly dynamic nature of cloud environments, where new resources are constantly being added and removed, poses new challenges. One of the main challenges organizations face is the lack of visibility into the cloud environment. As cloud computing continues to grow in complexity, it can be challenging to keep track of all the different resources and applications that make up the infrastructure. This lack of visibility can make it difficult to maintain security policies and configurations, making the infrastructure vulnerable to attacks.",

The new PVC\nretention policy lets users specify if the PVCs generated from the StatefulSet spec template should\nbe automatically deleted or retrained when the StatefulSet is deleted or replicas in the StatefulSet\nare scaled down.\nWhat problem does this solve?\nA StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the\nKubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior\nbefore the PVC retention policy was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for\nStatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on …",

At its core, clustering consists of the following problem: given a set of data elements, the goal is to partition the data elements into groups such that similar objects are in the same group, while dissimilar objects are in different groups. This problem has been studied in math, computer science, operations research and statistics for more than 60 years in its myriad variants.

However, the data collection process of manually annotating bounding boxes or instance masks is tedious and costly, which limits the modern detection vocabulary size to roughly 1,000 object classes. This is orders of magnitude smaller than the vocabulary people use to describe the visual world and leaves out many categories. Recent vision and language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated improved open-vocabulary visual recognition capabilities through learning from Internet-scale image-text pairs. These VLMs are applied to zero-shot classification using frozen model weights without the need for fine-…",

A single reference genome can’t incorporate known genetic variations, such as the variants for the gene determining whether a person has a blood type A, B, AB or O.

Contrastive learning trains the model to predict if image-text pairs correctly match, effectively building visual and text representations for the corresponding image and text inputs, whereas next-token prediction predicts the most likely next text token in a sequence, thus learning to generate text, according to the required task.
