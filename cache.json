There is so much, and all of it is usually stored in silos, making the data difficult to synthesize to provide better services, identify signals proactively, or make stronger business decisions. How do organizations overcome the challenges of understanding their data so that they can finally derive value from it, allowing organizations to truly put their data to work? \n\nThe answer is to shift your organization’s thinking away from the complexity of consolidating data to how to better find the answers within it.
