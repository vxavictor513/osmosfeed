          "description": ",\nArtificial intelligence for IT Operations (or AIOps) has been playing an expanding role in helping SREs, DevOps, and developers effectively navigate the challenges around application and infrastructure complexity, pace of change, and data volume that characterize the operations landscape. By improving efficiency and effectiveness of application and infrastructure monitoring by automating many of the tasks, AIOps can help to reduce the workload on observability teams and free up time to spend on more meaningful analysis.\n\nIn our first post, What is AIOps? A beginner’s guide, we dove into AIOps: what it is, why it matters, and establishing production readiness. We talked about why it’s important for an AIOps initiative to start simple with time tested and proven AIOps capabilities, and the…",

For example, a website or a web service gets HTTP requests and sends back responses in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.). For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.\nThe structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.\nThere are a few considerations to make such an application work wel…",

Following security best practices when developing and configuring microservices do not result in non-vulnerable microservices. The post shows that although all deployed microservices are vulnerable, there is much that can be done to ensure microservices are not exploited. It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here \"Security-Behavior Analysis\", can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices. It points to Guard, an open source project offering security-behavior monitoring and control of Kubernetes microservices presumed vulnerable.\nAs cyber attacks continue to intensify in sophistication, organizations deploying cloud services continue t…",
