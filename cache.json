          "description": ",\nIn 1991, a weather system formed off the east coast of the United States with a cold front that created a low pressure ridge to the east of Nova Scotia. At the same time, a high-pressure system extending out from the Appalachian Mountains forced the ridge first southeast and then to the west, where it encountered the remnants of Hurricane Grace, which it promptly absorbed and swelled in size as it did so. The resulting storm caused over $200 million of damage to the United States and was known as “The Perfect Storm,” later to be immortalized in a book of the same name. \n\nFor public sector organizations trying to deliver cybersecurity, a similar pattern is emerging — but perhaps with less visible effects. Disparate elements are combining with rapid intensity and have the potential to unleash a ferocious assault on the world’s cyber defenses.\nSecurity threats and citizen data,\nThirdly, given this proliferation of security threats and the need to protect citizen data, governments are likely to increase regulation and compliance requirements. This puts additional pressure on public sector teams to learn and implement these new requirements — it may also have the adverse effect of plugging holes today without thinking about future needs.",

Many times we’ve come across people using task after task to manipulate data, to turn items into lists, filter our options, trying to do heavy data manipulation and to turn data from one source into another. Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own. While many of these options will work, they aren’t very efficient or easy to implement. Ansible Playbooks were never meant for programming.",

Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim\nadmission validation mechanism within\nthe API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.\nHow to use it?\nAs this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.\nSimply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.\nFor more details, read about\ndefault StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.\nYou can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.\nTo provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)\nor participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.",

          "description": "Posted by Greg Corrado, Head of Health AI, Google Research, and Yossi Matias, VP, Engineering and Research, Google Research\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMedicine is an inherently multimodal discipline. When providing care, clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities including medical images, clinical notes, lab tests, electronic health records, genomics, and more.  Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations. The inputs to these systems tend to be complex data such as images, and they typically provide structured outputs, whether in the form of discrete grades o…",

Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. \n \n\nDesigning adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…",
