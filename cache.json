Then when you're ready to take your usage of Elastic to the next level of scalability and global availability, you can migrate your self-managed Elastic deployment to Elastic Cloud. \n\nThis blog post presents a step-by-step guide to help you do that using a snapshot and restore process that leverages Google Cloud Storage as the reliable storage location for saving and accessing the snapshot files that are central to the migration process.\nhttps://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt9cf8bf4be4ab335f/65c66d53edad335da0fadcee/signup-expedited-blog.png,signup-expedited-blog.pngStep 2: Migrate a self-manage Elastic stack to Elastic Cloud using Google Cloud\nThe process of migration involves taking a snapshot of the data in the self-managed Elastic stack, saving that snapshot to a Google Cloud Storage Bucket, and then restoring the snapshot to your Elastic Cloud deployment.

Originating from the Indian subcontinent, this story tells of six blindfolded individuals who encounter an elephant for the first time. Each individual touches a different part of the elephant — its side, tusk, trunk, knee, ear, and tail — and subsequently forms a distinct and limited understanding of what the elephant might be. The individual who feels the side believes the elephant to be a wall, the one who touches the tusk thinks it's a spear, and so forth. Subsequently, they argue fiercely, each convinced that their perception of the elephant is the whole truth. \nhttps://static-www.ela…",
