Thanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests.\nEnd of life\n\r\nIt’s just over a year since the release of Spring Boot 2.6.0 which means that, as per our open source support policy, 2.6.14 is the last release that’s planned in the 2.6.x line. Releases may be made in the future, but only in response to a commercial support request.\n\r\nAs previously announced, Spring Boot 2.7 will be the last minor in the 2.x line. As such, we’ve extended our open source support for 2.7.x release by an additional 6 months until November 2023. In addition, commercial support for Spring Boot 2.7 has also been extended and is available until February 2025.\nHow can you help?\n\r\nIf you’re interested in helping out, check out the “ideal for contribution” tag in the issue repository. If you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-boot tag or chat with the community on Gitter.\n\r\nProject Page | GitHub | Issues | Documentation | Stack Overflow | Gitter",

Join me, and we’ll dive deep into the engine and its interactions with the Spring component model. \n\r\nThis video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about. \n\r\nEnjoy! \n\r\n\r\nAlso, Happy thanksgiving (if you celebrate) from us to you!",

With a so-called “quantum simulator,” one could engineer a quantum computer to investigate how various quantum phenomena arise, including those that are intractable to simulate with a classical computer.  \n    \nBut making a useful quantum simulator has been a challenge. Until now, quantum simulations with superconducting qubits have predominantly been used to verify pre-existing theoretical predictions and have rarely explored or discovered new phenomena. Only a few experiments with trapped ions or cold atoms have revealed new insights. Superconducting qubits, even though they are one of the main…",

How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label.
