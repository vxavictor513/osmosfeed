For more details, read the following release notes for each version:

 You may by now be well experienced with ECS as a specification that provides a consistent and customizable way to structure your data in Elasticsearch, facilitating the analysis of data from diverse sources. With ECS, analytics content such as dashboards and machine learning jobs can be applied more broadly, searches can be crafted more narrowly, and field names are easier to remember.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[When it comes to malware attacks, one of the more common techniques is “living off the land” (LOtL). Utilizing standard tools or features that already exist in the target environment allows these attacks to blend into the environment and avoid detection. While these techniques can appear normal in isolation, they start looking suspicious when observed in the parent-child context. This is where the ProblemChild framework can help. 

In this blog, we will talk about how you can use Elastic machine learning to create your own ProblemChild framework to detect LOtL activity in Windows process event data (we will be referring to Windows process events as just “events” throughout this blog). We will talk in detail about the following:

From our early days as a lightweight Java project, we’ve relentlessly innovated — engineering an end-to-end Process Automation tech stack that has helped organizations across the globe automate mission-critical processes. But innovation never stops and organizations continue to look for new ways to increase the velocity of business transformation. To address this need, more and more organizations are turning to the cloud, which is increasingly becoming a business transformation accelerator.  That being said, as enterprise applications are being built entirely in the cloud, organizations are struggling with automating processes across multiple systems, people, and devices in an end-to-end manner. These processes often include modern components...

It provides unlimited scaling of storage while preserving the ability to efficiently query the data without any need to rehydrate it first, making it easier and cheaper to manage data at scale.

In this blog post we compare search performance on the new frozen tier with the existing Elasticsearch data tiers, and we show how with the frozen tier you can store and search far larger amounts of data at lower performance. The main highlights of the frozen tier are:

What is APM?
Application performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.



In addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:

WEF and WEC
 
Modern versions of Windows include the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services that implement the WS-Management (WSman) protocol, and just to add to the acronym spaghetti soup, this is all part of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). One component of WinRM is the Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) service, this is why WinRM and co. need to be enabled.

Tom Wilde, inside cloud account executive

After about two years as a user success manager, I began to master the art of outbound sales — cold calling potential enterprise customers, working to find new leads via LinkedIn, and having proof-of-concept conversations. But I was eager for the chance to learn how to make sales from inbound leads. My manager encouraged me to apply for an opening on the inside cloud account team and a more senior role.

Did you get an alert that heap usage is spiking on a specific server? A quick search of the logs filtered from that host shows that cache misses started around the same time as the initial spike. Digging into the metadata (date and version) of the highlighted logs from that time period show us that this was likely due to a recent code push. As seen here —  and in many other cases — logs hold the clues to what was happening during, before, or after an issue, which can help identify where to focus our attention next.

With a wider audience, I’m seeing more questions about managing resource allocation, in particular the mystical shard-heap ratio and avoiding circuit breakers. I get it! When I started with the Elastic Stack, I had the same questions. It was my first intro to managing Java heap and time series database shards, and scaling my own infrastructure.
