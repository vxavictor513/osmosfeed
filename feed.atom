Derivatives play a central role in optimization and machine learning. By locally approximating a training loss, derivatives guide an optimizer toward lower values of the loss. Automatic differentiation frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are an essential part of modern machine learning, making it feasible to use gradient-based optimizers to train very complex models.


 


But are derivatives all we need? By themselves, derivatives only tell us how a function behaves on an infinitesimal scale. To use derivatives effectively, we often need to know more than that. For example, to choose a learning rate for gradient descent, we need to know something about how the loss function behaves over a small but finite windo…]]></summary>

Reinforcement learning (RL) can enable robots to learn complex behaviors through trial-and-error interaction, getting better and better over time. Several of our prior works explored how RL can enable intricate robotic skills, such as robotic grasping, multi-task learning, and even playing table tennis. Although robotic RL has come a long way, we still don't see RL-enabled robots in everyday settings. The real world is complex, diverse, and changes over time, presenting a major challenge for robotic systems. However, we believe that RL should offer us an excellent tool for tackling precisely these challenges: by continually practicing, getting better, and l…]]></summary>

Observability is critical for effective security implementation. It allows organizations to monitor their systems, applications, and networks in real-time; detect and investigate security incidents; and quickly respond to them. But having multiple tools and solutions for observability can create a fragmented view of the environment, making it difficult to gain a comprehensive understanding of the security posture and respond to threats effectively.
This is where a unified observability solution becomes essential for organizations. It consolidates all data sources into a single platform, allowing security teams to view and correlate data from across the entire infrastructure. This provides a complete picture of the environment and enables security teams to quickly identify and respond to …]]></summary>

Building models that solve a diverse set of tasks has become a dominant paradigm in the domains of vision and language. In natural language processing, large pre-trained models, such as PaLM, GPT-3 and Gopher, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot learning of new language tasks. Similarly, in computer vision, models like CLIP and Flamingo have shown robust performance on zero-shot classification and object recognition. A natural next step is to use such tools to construct agents that can complete different decision-making tasks across many environments.



However, training such agents faces the inherent challenge of environmental diversity, since different environments operate with di…]]></summary>

A company’s culture shapes how people interact with each other, how much they like their job, and how invested they are in your organization. In short: culture is incredibly important. Because when people feel supported by their culture, they are more productive, less likely to leave, and most importantly, happier in their roles.  

Here at Elastic, we’ve built a  set of shared values, called our Source Code. Ask any Elastician and they’ll tell you that it is core to everything we do as a company. Not only is it discussed during the interview process, but there is an entire onboarding session dedicated to understanding its components.

Aging is a process that is characterized by physiological and molecular changes that increase an individual's risk of developing diseases and eventually dying. Being able to measure and estimate the biological signatures of aging can help researchers identify preventive measures to reduce disease risk and impact. Researchers have developed “aging clocks” based on markers such as blood proteins or DNA methylation to measure individuals’ biological age, which is distinct from one’s chronological age. These aging clocks help predict the risk of age-related diseases. But because protein and methylation markers require a blood draw, non-invasive ways to find similar measures could make aging i…]]></summary>

This blog post summarizes a trio of “big data” topics — metadata, distributed search, and dynamic categorization — that have actually been part of the information retrieval landscape for quite a while, but seem to periodically lose favor and then reappear over time. 

I’m starting to believe that these recurring patterns are actually generational — meaning that each successive generation of technologists runs up against the same problems and tries to solve them with the technology of the day, but using the same old techniques. 

What they don’t realize is that the workarounds have become institutionalized — the solutions of the past became a limiting factor in the technology landscape that continues to hide the underlying problem: that the relative value of data is subjective and constan…]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.27: Chill Vibes
The theme for Kubernetes v1.27 is Chill Vibes.
It's a little silly, but there were some important shifts in this release that helped inspire the theme. Throughout a typical Kubernetes release cycle, there are several deadlines that features need to meet to remain included. If a feature misses any of these deadlines, there is an exception process they can go through. Handling these exceptions is a very normal part of the release.

Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a powerful tool widely used for global optimization tasks, such as hyperparameter tuning, protein engineering, synthetic chemistry, robot learning, and even baking cookies. BayesOpt is a great strategy for these problems because they all involve optimizing black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. A black-box function’s underlying mapping from inputs (configurations of the thing we want to optimize) to outputs (a measure of performance) is unknown. However, we can attempt to understand its internal workings by evaluating the function for different combinations of inputs. Because each evaluation can be computationally expensive, we need to find the best i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent post, we showed you how to get started with the free and open tier of Elastic Observability. Below, we'll walk through what you need to do to expand your deployment so you can start gathering metrics from application performance monitoring (APM) or "tracing" data in your observability cluster, for free.
What is APM?
Application performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.

In addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:

The problem
Since v1.19 (released in 2020), the Kubernetes project provides 12-14 months of patch releases for each minor version.
This enables users to qualify and adopt Kubernetes versions in an annual upgrade cycle and receive security fixes for a year.
The Go project releases new minor versions twice a year,
and provides security fixes for the last two minor versions, resulting in about a year of support for each Go version.
Even though each new Kubernetes minor version is built with a supported Go version when it is first released,
that Go version falls out of support before the Kubernetes minor version does,
and the lengthened Kubernetes patch support since v1.19 only widened that gap.
At the time this was written, just over half of all Go patch releas…]]></summary>

However, the UI abstraction over Elasticsearch can make it tricky to diagnose performance issues in individual panels — especially for developers used to diving into the detail of implementations using debuggers and other profiling tools.
This blog introduces four approaches to help investigate and diagnose performance issues with Kibana dashboards. Specifically, we'll cover the use of Elastic application performance monitoring (APM), debugging via Chrome Developer Tools and profiling, inspecting individual panels via the Inspector, and the Elasticsearch Slow Log to identify the cause of dashboard slowness.

When Diana Zuniga graduated from college in 2022 she didn’t know what her next step was. 

“I was lost,” she says. “As a first generation American, I don’t have anyone to look up to and ask questions to. I was trying to find myself.”
She earned a degree in psychology and was considering going back to school, but she had always had an interest in working for a tech company.


“I knew that tech was a booming industry, so I was interested to see how I could bring in my skills and my psych background,” Diana says. “Being a Latina, I was scared to go into this industry where people like me aren't really seen, so I wanted to become that representation for others like myself.”

Moving to the Cloud introduces unique security challenges 
It's no surprise that organizations are moving to the cloud to innovate — to meet the growing demands of their customers and digital transformation. Organizations want to build applications that are fast and scalable. They want to make use of the latest cloud-native capabilities like containers, orchestrators, microservices, APIs, and declarative infrastructure. 

However, this also means security in the cloud cannot be an afterthought. It needs to go hand-in-hand with application development in the cloud. When we talk to security teams, they face unique challenges when it comes to protecting the cloud, including:

The efficiency, security, and scalability of cloud operations are driving financial institutions’ adoption of the technology faster than ever before. The ability to meet customers where they want to transact, personalize solutions, and leverage new data and analytics solutions (including AI) on-demand is driving this growth. In fact, according to Accenture, the banking industry's workloads in the cloud more than doubled from 2021 to 2022.
However, despite the rapid pace of change, more than 85% of banking workloads still remain on-prem. Part of the apprehension to send more workloads to the cloud has to do with underlying cloud security concerns.

Machine learning (ML) offers tremendous potential, from diagnosing cancer to engineering safe self-driving cars to amplifying human productivity. To realize this potential, however, organizations need ML solutions to be reliable with ML solution development that is predictable and tractable. The key to both is a deeper understanding of ML data — how to engineer training datasets that produce high quality models and test datasets that deliver accurate indicators of how close we are to solving the target problem.

Admission control is an important part of the Kubernetes control plane, with several internal
features depending on the ability to approve or change an API object as it is submitted to the
server. It is also useful for an administrator to be able to define business logic, or policies,
regarding what objects can be admitted into a cluster. To better support that use case, Kubernetes
introduced external admission control in
v1.7.
In addition to countless custom, internal implementations, many open source projects and commercial
solutions implement admission controllers with user-specified policy, including
Kyverno and Open Policy Agent’s
Gatekeeper.
While admission controllers for policy have seen adoption, there are blockers for their widespr…]]></summary>

Large deep learning models are becoming the workhorse of a variety of critical machine learning (ML) tasks. However, it has been shown that without any protection it is plausible for bad actors to attack a variety of models, across modalities, to reveal information from individual training examples. As such, it’s essential to protect against this sort of information leakage.


Differential privacy (DP) provides formal protection against an attacker who aims to extract information about the training data. The most popular method for DP training in deep learning is differentially private stochastic gradient descent (DP-SGD). The core recipe implements a common theme in DP: “fuzzing” an algor…]]></summary>

Virtual assistants are increasingly integrated into our daily routines. They can help with everything from setting alarms to giving map directions and can even assist people with disabilities to more easily manage their homes. As we use these assistants, we are also becoming more accustomed to using natural language to accomplish tasks that we once did by hand. 


 

One of the biggest challenges in building a robust virtual assistant is identifying what a user wants and what information is needed to perform the task at hand. In the natural language processing (NLP) literature, this is mainly framed as a task-oriented dialogue parsing task, where a given dialogue needs to be parsed by a system to understand the…]]></summary>

Last year we presented results demonstrating that a deep learning system (DLS) can be trained to analyze external eye photos and predict a person’s diabetic retinal disease status and elevated glycated hemoglobin (or HbA1c, a biomarker that indicates the three-month average level of blood glucose). It was previously unknown that external eye photos contained signals for these conditions. This exciting finding suggested the potential to reduce the need for specialized equipment since such photos can be captured using smartphones and other consumer devices. Encouraged by these findings, we set out to discover what other biomarkers can be found in this imaging modality.

Building robots that are proficient at navigation requires an interconnected understanding of (a) vision and natural language (to associate landmarks or follow instructions), and (b) spatial reasoning (to connect a map representing an environment to the true spatial distribution of objects).

I first discovered my passion for tech sales as a college graduate working in Silicon Valley.
