The tool, which is available in Kibana®’s Machine Learning section, simplifies the task of identifying what contributes to unusual spikes or drops in log rates: Is the root cause a specific service in your stack? Is it limited to a particular region? Are there shared characteristics among log messages contributing to this change? Historically, addressing these investigations required SREs to dedicate hours manually comparing logs and metadata to determine whether the change in log rate represented a genuine issue and, if so, its root cause.

When comparing Elastic®’s data tiers to Amazon OpenSearch Service tiers, there’s yet another challenge — the same terms don't mean the same thing. Through this explanation, we seek to clear up any misconceptions around similar data tier terminology between Elastic and Amazon OpenSearch Service.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elastic Search 8.12 contains new innovations for developers to intuitively utilize artificial intelligence and machine learning models to elevate search experiences with lightning fast performance and enhanced relevance. This version of Elastic® is built on Apache Lucene 9.9, the fastest Lucene release ever, and updates some of our most popular integrations such as Amazon S3, MongoDB, MySQL, and more. Our inference API abstracts the complexity of embedding management behind a single API call, and kNN is now elevated to a query type.
By simply upgrading, customers can gain an incredible speed increase compared to search experiences built with older versions of Elastic, and developers will have more effective tools to tailor the search experience, with cleaner code that’s easier to maintain.…]]></summary>

The mechanism uses a mutating webhook, which is a standard Kubernetes component, but you don’t need to know all the details to use the Attacher. Essentially, you can install the Attacher, add one annotation to any Kubernetes deployment that has an application you want monitored, and that’s it!

In this blog, we’ll walk through a full example from scratch using a Java application. Apart from the Java code and using a JVM for the application, everything else works the same for the other languages supported by the Attacher.

This change introduces a new level of complexity and an array of cybersecurity threats. 

With 5G networks, the reliance on open, standardized IT technologies and cloud-native approaches like containerization heightens the risks of cyber attacks, as these systems often have broader exposure to known and 0 day threats. The integration of AI and IoT within this new architecture further amplifies the security challenges and puts pressure on having robust and advanced security measures for telecom operators.

The physician-patient conversation is a cornerstone of medicine, in which skilled and intentional communication drives diagnosis, management, empathy and trust. AI systems capable of such diagnostic dialogues could increase availability, accessibility, quality and consistency of care by being useful conversational partners to clinicians and patients alike. But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. 





Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations. However, there are many aspects of good diagnostic dialogue that are unique to the medical domain. …]]></summary>

LLMs are increasingly popular for reasoning tasks, such as multi-turn QA, task completion, code generation, or mathematics. Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.



This has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…]]></summary>
