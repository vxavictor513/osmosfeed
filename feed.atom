The Kubernetes community recently announced
that their legacy package repositories are frozen, and now they moved to
introduced community-owned package repositories powered by the
OpenBuildService (OBS).
CRI-O has a long history of utilizing
OBS for their package builds,
but all of the packaging efforts have been done manually so far.
The CRI-O community absolutely loves Kubernetes, which means that they're
delighted to announce that:
All future CRI-O packages will be shipped as part of the officially supported
Kubernetes infrastructure hosted on pkgs.k8s.io!

As most people navigate their everyday world, they process visual input from the environment using an eye-level perspective. Unlike robots and self-driving cars, people don't have any "out-of-body" sensors to help guide them. Instead, a person’s sensory input is completely "egocentric", or "from the self." This also applies to new technologies that understand the world around us from a human-like perspective, e.g., robots navigating through unknown buildings, AR glasses that highlight objects, or assistive technology to help people run independently.





In computer vision, scene understanding is the subfield that studies how visible objects relate to the sce…]]></summary>

Typical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. 



Using methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons. Firs…]]></summary>

Elastic Observability is the premiere tool to provide visibility into web apps running in your environment. AWS App Runner is the serverless platform of choice to run your web apps that need to scale up and down massively to meet demand or minimize costs. Elastic Observability combined with AWS App Runner is the perfect solution for developers to deploy web apps that are auto-scaled with fully observable operations, in a way that’s straightforward to implement and manage. 
This blog post will show you how to deploy a simple Hello World web app to App Runner and then walk you through the steps to instrument the Hello World web app to enable observation of the application’s operations with Elastic Cloud.

Elastic® has enabled the collection, transformation, and analysis of data flowing between the external data sources and Elastic Observability Solution through integrations. Integration packages achieve this by encapsulating several components, including agent configuration, inputs for data collection, and assets like ingest pipelines, data streams, index templates, and visualizations. The breadth of these assets supported in the Elastic Stack increases day by day. 
This blog dives into how input packages provide an extremely generic and flexible solution to the advanced users for customizing their ingestion experience in Elastic.

A mobile phone’s camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…]]></summary>

Researchers currently don’t understand the full picture of how glitches in its network machinery contribute to mental illnesses and other diseases, such as dementia. However, the emerging connectomics field, which aims to precisely map the connections between every cell in the brain, could help solve that problem. While maps have only been created for simpler organisms, technological advances for mapping even larger brains can enable us to understand how the human brain works, and how to treat brain diseases.



Today, we're excited to announce that the Connectomics team at Google Research and …]]></summary>

What a journey so far!
Starting from the initial blog post “How we made Kubernetes insanely easy to install” in September 2016, followed by an exciting growth that lead to general availability / “Production-Ready Kubernetes Cluster Creation with kubeadm” two years later.
And later on a continuous, steady and reliable flow of small improvements that is still going on as of today.
What is kubeadm? (quick refresher)
kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes
are created by running kubeadm init and
worker nodes are joined to the control plane by running
kubeadm join.

The kubeadm tool now supports etcd learner mode, which
allows you to enhance the resilience and stability
of your Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the learner mode
feature introduced in etcd version 3.4.
This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption
in Kubernetes clusters:

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.

In recent years, we have witnessed rising interest across consumers and researchers in integrated augmented reality (AR) experiences using real-time face feature generation and editing functions in mobile applications, including short videos, virtual reality, and gaming. As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques. However, the majority of GAN models suffer from high computational complexity and the need for a large training dataset. In addition, it is also important to employ GAN models responsibly.

Kubernetes v1.25 introduced support for user namespaces for only stateless
pods. Kubernetes 1.28 lifted that restriction, after some design changes were
done in 1.27.
The beauty of this feature is that:
it is trivial to adopt (you just need to set a bool in the pod spec)
doesn't need any changes for most applications
improves security by drastically enhancing the isolation of containers and
mitigating CVEs rated HIGH and CRITICAL.
This post explains the basics of user namespaces and also shows:
the changes that arrived in the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release

Routing in Google Maps remains one of our most helpful and frequently used features. Determining the best route from A to B requires making complex trade-offs between factors including the estimated time of arrival (ETA), tolls, directness, surface conditions (e.g., paved, unpaved roads), and user preferences, which vary across transportation mode and local geography. Often, the most natural visibility we have into travelers' preferences is by analyzing real-world travel patterns.



Learning preferences from observed sequential decision making behavior is a classic application of inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Given a Markov decision process (MDP) — a formalization of the road network — and a set of demonstration traject…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes development cycle is an evolving landscape with a myriad of tools seeking to streamline the process. Each tool has its unique approach, and the choice often comes down to individual project requirements, the team's expertise, and the preferred workflow.
Among the various solutions, a category we dubbed “Local K8S Development tools” has emerged, which seeks to enhance the Kubernetes development experience by connecting locally running components to the Kubernetes cluster. This facilitates rapid testing of new code in cloud conditions, circumventing the traditional cycle of Dockerization, CI, and deployment.
In this post, we compare three solutions in this category: Telepresence, Gefyra, and our own contender, mirrord.
