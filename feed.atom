Over the past 18 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about their scenarios. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using tools that their developers are familiar with and have been using for years, and they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications which are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like New Relic.

But on the other hand, this has made monitoring applications and their underpinning infrastructure more complex. Fortunately, Elastic has been widely used for infrastructure and application monitoring solutions for many years — both as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and more recently as Elastic Observability.

In this multi-part series, I’ll focus on a few of the time-related aspects of software performance — particularly for security software. Each post in this series will focus on a single topic, including how to identify performance issues, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in future.

Most data is constantly changing. When querying an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially searching for data at a given point of time. With an index that is constantly changing — as in most observability and security use cases — two identical queries performed at two different times will return different results because the data has changed over time. So, what do you do if you need to remove that time variable?
The point in time (PIT) reader, which was introduced in Elasticsearch 7.10, gives you the ability to repeatedly query an index as it was at a specific point in time.

Start here. Spring Native is awesome and this is the comprehensive introduction I wish I’d had at the start. 

The next time we meet in this humble column, next week, will be June 22nd, and by then we’ll have passed summer solstice - the longest day in the year! - and the beginning of summer. Farewell (for now) to Spring, the season, and long live Spring, the easiest and most productive path to production for your applications. 

Anyway, my friends, we’ve got a ton of things to look at this week, starting of course with that Spring Native video and release announcement, of course, so let’s get to it! 


  
In this week’s installment of Spring Tips, I look at Spring Native 0.10.0, available now.

Despite the name, PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx callbacks are not actually invoked upon the creation of processes, but rather upon the creation of the first threads within those processes. This creates a gap between when a process is created and when security products are notified of its creation. It also gives malware authors a window to tamper with the backing executable before security products can scan it. R…]]></summary>
