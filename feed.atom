“In college, I didn’t even know support was an option. I thought I would end up working at a help desk or as a developer in a company,” Kesia shares. “My first exposure to support was actually as a trainee with IBM. They allocated me to this thing called ‘support’ and had me start debugging files.”
Despite her hesitancy at the jump, that trainee experience opened Kesia’s eyes to a new realm of possibilities — one that aligned perfectly with both her social disposition and love of solving problems. Fast forward 10 years, and Kesia is now thriving as a full-time support engineer with Elastic, the leading platform for search-powered solutions with a robust support department.

A leading telecom provider1 in the US cited a 13% jump in ransomware attacks in the past year. And in Europe, the latest cybersecurity report from European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)2 states that telecommunications were the target for 26% of DDoS attacks, a fourfold increase from 2021 due to remote working.
So what has changed in the past couple of years? For the telecom industry in particular, two things stand out: 5G and cloud adoption.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Using the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework, ThoughtLab concluded a cybersecurity benchmark study that spanned across industries, including telecommunications. There is an urgent call to action for organizations to think about and implement cybersecurity processes and technologies more strategically. The study shed some positive light for telecom companies as compared to peer industries. But, the MTTx (detect, respond, mitigate) and threat dwell time are high enough to raise serious concerns about how well armed the industry is to protect such critical network infrastructure.

A common issue in running/operating Kubernetes clusters is running out of disk space.
When the node is provisioned, you should aim to have a good amount of storage space for your container images and running containers.
The container runtime usually writes to /var.
This can be located as a separate partition or on the root filesystem.
CRI-O, by default, writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containers, while containerd writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containerd.
In this blog post, we want to bring attention to ways that you can configure your container runtime to store its content separately from the default partition.
One area that needs more explaining is where/what Kubernetes is writing to disk.

The Release Special Interest Group (SIG Release), where Kubernetes sharpens its blade
with cutting-edge features and bug fixes every 4 months. Have you ever considered how such a big
project like Kubernetes manages its timeline so efficiently to release its new version, or how
the internal workings of the Release Team look like? If you're curious about these questions or
want to know more and get involved with the work SIG Release does, read on!
SIG Release plays a crucial role in the development and evolution of Kubernetes.
Its primary responsibility is to manage the release process of new versions of Kubernetes.
It operates on a regular release cycle, typically every three to four months.
During this cycle, the Kubernetes Release Team works closely with other SIGs an…]]></summary>

The physician-patient conversation is a cornerstone of medicine, in which skilled and intentional communication drives diagnosis, management, empathy and trust. AI systems capable of such diagnostic dialogues could increase availability, accessibility, quality and consistency of care by being useful conversational partners to clinicians and patients alike. But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. 





Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations. However, there are many aspects of good diagnostic dialogue that are unique to the medical domain. …]]></summary>

LLMs are increasingly popular for reasoning tasks, such as multi-turn QA, task completion, code generation, or mathematics. Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.



This has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…]]></summary>
