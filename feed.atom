It is very common in Elasticsearch to request results to be sorted by a certain field. We have invested a great deal of time and effort to optimize sort queries to make them faster for our users. This blog will describe some of the sort optimizations for numeric and date fields.

In the worst case of a very broad filter (e.g. match_all query), we have to examine and compare doc values for all documents in an index. For big indices, this may take a substantial amount of time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am excited to announce that Spring HATEOAS 1.4 GA has been part of the cascade of releases that lead to the Spring Boot 2.6 last week.
The release ships a couple of new features and all bug fixes we have incorporated in the 1.3.x line.
The most notable new features are:





Full support for level 4 URI templates



Support for non-composite request parameter rendering



Improved HAL-FORMS support (additional property constraints, custom media types)



Additional HTML input types (checkbox, radio, file)



General dependency upgrades, including Spring Framework 5.3.13 and Jackson 2.13.9.





Find more detailed information about all changes made in the 1.4 line in the release’s change log.
The release was included in the Spring Boot 2.6 release announced last week.
In other words, if you have upgraded to that, you’ve already successfully upgraded to Spring HATEOAS 1.4.



We have also released maintenance versions for the 1.3 and 1.2 lines.
Please note, that 1.2.11 is the last release of that branch and 1.2 is going out of OSS maintenance.
Find more about the support timelines for each branch in the newly introduced tab of our project homepage.



Also note, that due to a typo during the release procedure for 1.2.11, a 1.12.11 release has made it onto Maven Central.
The binaries are logically equivalent to 1.2.11, but their presence is likely to cause trouble with tools automating library upgrades.
We’re currently working with Sonatype to investigate options to potentially remove the invalid artifacts.]]></summary>

Smart Text Selection, launched in 2017 as part of Android O, is one of Android’s most frequently used features, helping users select, copy, and use text easily and quickly by predicting the desired word or set of words around a user’s tap, and automatically expanding the selection appropriately. Through this feature, selections are automatically expanded, and for selections with defined classification types, e.g., addresses and phone numbers, users are offered an app with which to open the selection, saving users even more time.

One of the nicest things about Byte Buddy is that it allows you to write a Java agent without manually having to deal with byte code. To instrument a method, agent authors can simply write the code they want to inject in pure Java. This makes writing Java agents much more accessible and avoids complicated on-boarding requirements.
After the first successful experiments, agent authors often get hit by a wall of complexity that the JVM throws at them: class loaders (OSGi, oh my!), class visibility, dependence on internal APIs, class path scanners, and version conflicts to name a few. 
In this article, we'll look at a relatively novel approach to break through this wall of complexity. The architecture, which is based on the invokedynamic bytecode instruction, a bytecode that is best known f…]]></summary>

Despite considerable progress in robot learning over the past several years, some policies for robotic agents can still struggle to decisively choose actions when trying to imitate precise or complex behaviors. Consider a task in which a robot tries to slide a block across a table to precisely position it into a slot. There are many possible ways to solve this task, each requiring precise movements and corrections. The robot must commit to just one of these options, but must also be capable of changing plans each time the block ends up sliding farther than expected. Although one might expect such a task to be easy, that is often not the case for modern learning-based robots, which often le…]]></summary>

Hi, Spring fans! It’s Friday, and you know what that means? Some poor schlub somewhere is trying fruitlessly to get something deployed to production, or at least rolled back consistently, in time for dinner. And it’s not working. I’ve been there. Deployments are hard. There’s nuance in deployment. I love Kubernetes as much as the next Operator, but let’s not pretend it’s the pinnacle of productivity. Quite the contrary. There’s a whole cottage industry around simplifying application deployments with Kubernetes. See for example KNative,  Cloud Foundry on Ku…]]></summary>

Illiteracy affects at least 773 million people globally, both young and old. For these individuals, reading information from unfamiliar sources or on unfamiliar topics can be extremely difficult. Unfortunately, these inequalities have been further magnified by the global pandemic as a result of unequal access to education in reading and writing. In fact, UNESCO reports that over 100 million children are falling behind the minimum proficiency level in reading due to COVID-related school closures.

 Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on learning from experiences to solve decision making tasks. While the field of RL has made great progress, resulting in impressive empirical results on complex tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons and designing hardware chips, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the current standards for empirical evaluation might give a false sense of fast scientific progress while slowing it down.

An invaluable way to share best practices across your company, teams, and network is by sharing assets. We will present the export option of the elastic-package tool that will make your asset sharing as easy as ABC. In this guide you will walk through the elastic-package export option and learn about sharing and spreading useful dashboards.
Instead of reinventing the wheel, try to repurpose the work that has already been done. Some Kibana dashboards have already been created for you, but why not share yours as well.

Deep learning has successfully been applied to a wide range of important challenges, such as cancer prevention and increasing accessibility. The application of deep learning models to weather forecasts can be relevant to people on a day-to-day basis, from helping people plan their day to managing food production, transportation systems, or the energy grid. Weather forecasts typically rely on traditional physics-based techniques powered by the world’s largest supercomputers. Such methods are constrained by high computational requirements and are sensitive to approximations of the physical laws on which they are based.

Most wearable smart devices and mobile phones have the means to communicate with the user through tactile feedback, enabling applications from simple notifications to sensory substitution for accessibility. Typically, they accomplish this using vibrotactile actuators, which are small electric vibration motors. However, designing a haptic system that is well-targeted and effective for a given task requires experimentation with the number of actuators and their locations in the device, yet most practical applications require standalone on-body devices and integration into small form factors. This combination of factors can be difficult to address outside of a laboratory as integrating these systems can be quite time-consuming and…]]></summary>

Machine learning (ML) agents are increasingly deployed in the real world to make decisions and assist people in their daily lives. Making reasonable predictions about the future at varying timescales is one of the most important capabilities for such agents because it enables them to predict changes in the world around them, including other agents’ behaviors, and plan how to act next. Importantly, successful future prediction requires both capturing meaningful transitions in the environment (e.g., dough transforming into bread) and adapting to how transitions unfold over time in order to make decisions.

When building a deep model for a new machine learning application, researchers often begin with existing network architectures, such as ResNets or EfficientNets. If the initial model’s accuracy isn’t high enough, a larger model may be a tempting alternative, but may not actually be the best solution for the task at hand. Instead, better performance potentially could be achieved by designing a new model that is optimized for the task. However, such efforts can be challenging and usually require considerable resources.  
In “Wisdom of Committees: An Overlooked Approach to Faster and More Accurate Models”,  we discuss model ensembles and a subset called model cascades, both of which…]]></summary>

Earlier this year, we launched Contactless Sleep Sensing in Nest Hub, an opt-in feature that can help users better understand their sleep patterns and nighttime wellness. While some of the most critical sleep insights can be derived from a person’s overall schedule and duration of sleep, that alone does not tell the complete story. The human brain has special neurocircuitry to coordinate sleep cycles — transitions between deep, light, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of sleep — vital not only for physical and emotional wellbeing, but also for optimal physical and cognitive performance.

For more than 70 years, plasma physicists have dreamed of controlled “breakeven” fusion, where a system is capable of releasing more energy in a fusion reaction than it takes to initiate and sustain those reactions. The challenge is that the reactor must create a plasma at a temperature of tens of millions of degrees, which requires a highly complex, finely tuned system to confine and sustain. Further, creating the plasma and maintaining it, requires substantial amounts of energy, which, to date, have exceeded that released in the fusion reaction itself. Nevertheless, if a “breakeven” system could be achieved, it could provide ample zero-carbon electricity, the potential impact of which has driven interest by government…]]></summary>

An approach commonly used to train agents for a range of applications from robotics to chip design is reinforcement learning (RL). While RL excels at discovering how to solve tasks from scratch, it can struggle in training an agent to understand the reversibility of its actions, which can be crucial to ensure that agents behave in a safe manner within their environment. For instance, robots are generally costly and require maintenance, so one wants to avoid taking actions that might lead to broken components. Estimating if an action is reversible or not (or better, how easily it can be reversed) requires a working knowledge of the physics of the environment in which the agent is operating. However, in the standard …]]></summary>
