While model design and training data are key ingredients in a deep neural network’s (DNN’s) success, less-often discussed is the specific optimization method used for updating the model parameters (weights). Training DNNs involves minimizing a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the ground truth labels and the model’s predictions. Training is carried out by backpropagation, which adjusts the model weights via gradient descent steps. Gradient descent, in turn, updates the weights by using the gradient (i.e., derivative) of the loss with respect to the weights. 
The simplest weight update corresponds to stochastic gradient descent, which, in every step, moves the weights…]]></summary>

In natural conversations, we don't say people's names every time we speak to each other. Instead, we rely on contextual signaling mechanisms to initiate conversations, and eye contact is often all it takes. Google Assistant, now available in more than 95 countries and over 29 languages, has primarily relied on a hotword mechanism ("Hey Google" or “OK Google”) to help more than 700 million people every month get things done across Assistant devices. As virtual assistants become an integral part of our everyday lives, we're developing ways to initiate conversations more naturally.

The increasing complexity of code poses a key challenge to productivity in software engineering. Code completion has been an essential tool that has helped mitigate this complexity in integrated development environments (IDEs). Conventionally, code completion suggestions are implemented with rule-based semantic engines (SEs), which typically have access to the full repository and understand its semantic structure. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (e.g., Codex and PaLM) enable longer and more complex code suggestions, and as a result, useful products have emerged (e.g., Copilot). However, the question of how code completion powered by machine learnin…]]></summary>

That is, most of the work on the company's critical cloud project is being done by consultants and vendors, and not by their team members. Unfortunately, much of the staff’s time is spent making sure that the infrastructure as code (IaC) implementation is in compliance with the standards and policies that his company has for cloud resources. Nelson said, “Oftentimes the code works, but doesn’t conform to naming conventions, or is missing labels, or has security issues, which impacts downstream workflows and applications. We need the environment to conform to our policies, and I don’t want my staff burning cycles to ensure that this is the case.” This was the reason why he brought me in to run a proof of concept (POC).

Elastic App Search allows developers to bring the power of Elasticsearch to mobile apps in a pretuned search experience. 

When parsing body text, the App Search crawler extracts all the content from the specified website and spreads it in fields depending on the HTML tags it finds. Text within title tags are assumed as title field, anchor tags are parsed as links, and body is parsed as one giant field with everything else. 

But what if a website has a custom structure — for example, the color, size, and price included on product pages — that you want to capture in specific fields and not as part of a single body field?

App Search allows you to add meta tags to your website to create custom fields, but sometimes making changes on the website is too complicated or just not possible.

Current deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods can train specialist artificial agents that excel at decision-making on various individual tasks in specific environments, such as Go or StarCraft. However, little progress has been made to extend these results to generalist agents that would not only be capable of performing many different tasks, but also upon a variety of environments with potentially distinct embodiments. 
Looking across recent progress in the fields of natural language processing, vision, and generative models (such as PaLM, Imagen, and Flamingo), we see that breakthroughs in making general-purpose models are often achieved by scaling up Transformer-based models an…]]></summary>

Therefore, you must be able to accurately express all the things happening in your business processes for proper end-to-end process orchestration. This requires workflow patterns that go beyond basic control flow patterns (like sequence or condition). If your orchestration tool does not provide those advanced workflow patterns, you will experience confusion amongst developers, you will need to implement time-consuming workarounds, and you will end up with confusing models. Let’s explore this by examining an example of why these advanced workflow patterns matter in today’s blog post.

Managed Detection and Response Services (MDRS) extend well beyond the capacities of the traditional Managed Security Service Provider (MSSP) model. They strive for deeper infrastructure monitoring, response to detected threats, and a full SOC-grade portfolio of proactive capabilities such as threat hunting, forensics, and advanced analytics and reporting.

Elastic, which has historically been used as a powerful threat hunting platform, now provides a unified security solution that encapsulates security information and event management (SIEM) and endpoint security capabilities in the industry’s first free and open Limitless XDR platform.

The solution unifies prevention, detection, investigation, and response in one platform that can be the foundation of a massive scale MDRS.

Observability enables organizations to collect metrics, logs, and traces with high dimensionality to detect root causes faster and answer the unknown unknowns. With Application Performance Monitoring (APM) for log, infrastructure, and digital experience monitoring, decision-making becomes less about having a crystal ball and more about having a live view of the state of the enterprise. Observability is key to enabling d…]]></summary>

This fourth milestone introduces several improvements for Java Records support. It also comes with a number of enhancements, bug fixes, dependency upgrades, and documentation updates. For more details about all the changes, see the release notes.
Java Records Support Improvement

The support for Java records as items in a chunk-oriented step was initially introduced in v4.3, but that support was limited, due to the fact that v4 has Java 8 as a baseline. In Java 8, records were not even in preview yet. That initial support was based on reflection tricks to create Java records and populate them with data, without having access to the j…]]></summary>

Every year, nearly a billion chest X-ray (CXR) images are taken globally to aid in the detection and management of health conditions ranging from collapsed lungs to infectious diseases. Generally, CXRs are cheaper and more accessible than other forms of medical imaging. However, existing challenges continue to impede the optimal use of CXRs. For example, in some areas, trained radiologists that can accurately interpret CXR images are in short supply. In addition, interpretation variability between experts, workflow differences between institutions, and the presence of rare conditions familiar only to subspecialists all contribute to making high-quality CXR interpretation a challenge.

Eleni Syrmou spent the majority of her working life living a plane ride away from the rest of her family. She lived in London, UK for 15 years before moving back to Southern Europe—a tiny house in Sicily to be exact. But her former employer wanted her back in the office, and back in London. 

After their reluctance to let her continue to work remotely, Eleni decided it was time to find a company that celebrated working remotely. She joined Elastic in May 2021 as Lead Recruiter, Southern Europe. 

Now, she works from a converted stone farmhouse that is a two minute walk from the beach and surrounded by orchards, potato farms, and olive groves.

What’s the potential business value of moving to the cloud? According to McKinsey, it’s a cool $1 trillion that’s up for grabs.

It’s such a huge number that it may seem like pie in the sky. But companies are already positioning themselves to grab a piece of that pie for themselves. The most recent example is FedEx, which made headlines earlier this month when it announced that it plans to move entirely to cloud-native structures within two years. The shipping giant estimates that it will save about $400 million annually. 

CFOs may be excited about the cost-benefit analysis, but IT teams have a lot to gain, too. From operational efficiencies to innovation, CFOs and CIOs should be building this plan together.

Deep learning models have made impressive progress in vision, language, and other modalities, particularly with the rise of large-scale pre-training. Such models are most accurate when applied to test data drawn from the same distribution as their training set. However, in practice, the data confronting models in real-world settings rarely match the training distribution. In addition, the models may not be well-suited for applications where predictive performance is only part of the equation. For models to be reliable in deployment, they must be able to accommodate shifts in data distribution and make useful decisions in a broad array of scenarios.

Visual Question Answering (VQA) is a useful machine learning (ML) task that requires a model to answer a visual question about an image. What makes it challenging is its multi-task and open-ended nature; it involves solving multiple technical research questions in computer vision and natural language understanding simultaneously. Yet, progress on this task would enable a wide range of applications, from assisting the blind and the visually-impaired or communicating with robots to enhancing the user’s visual experience with external knowledge.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
The convergence of information technologies (IT) and operational technologies (OT) sits at the core of the Industry 4.0 vision (industrial Internet of Things). This gradual convergence began more than a decade ago, and according to a recent McKinsey study, investments in industrialization paid rich dividends to the early adopters of Industry 4.0.*

But this process changed dramatically with the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, which created a massive, multiyear ripple effect on worldwide economies, forcing manufacturers to reevaluate their priorities.

How are manufacturers adapting to today’s industrial world? Here are their top three priorities as they accelerate IT/OT convergence for increased productivity, faster innovation, and a more trustworthy customer experience.

Panoptic segmentation is a computer vision problem that serves as a core task for many real-world applications.

Each sub-task is processed individually, and extra modules are applied to merge the results from each sub-task stage.

This week I’m writing you from sunny Seattle, Washington, where we’re having our next installment of the SpringOne Tour series. It’s been a ton of fun seeing all these fun and friendly faces again and getting to see people, many of whom I haven’t seen since before the pandemic! I’ve also had a lot of fun seeing some friends from some of the big cloud companies here, Microsoft and AWS. It’s always interesting to learn how people are using the latest and greatest from Spring to build amazing systems and software targeting these cloud platforms.

We’ve got a lot to cover this week so let’s dive right into it!


  
In last week’s podcast, I talked to Kubernetes contributor and fellow Tanzu Developer Advocate Leigh Capili

  
Distributed Tracing With OpenTelemetry, Spring Cloud Sleuth, Kafka, and Jaeger

  
Ingress vs. Load Balancer in Kubernetes

  
Instantiating Multiple Beans of the Same Class with Spring Annotations

  
Curious about when and why to use Java 14 Records vs. Lombok? Check out this article

  
I put together this little example , thanks to Reactor lead Simon Baslé, showing how to handle pagination with the expand operator in Project Reactor: Pagination in a Reactive Application. It looks at how to eleganrly expand the contents of a reactive stream as new data (in a data pagination scenario) becomes available.

  
Spring Shell 2.1.0-RC1 is now available

  
Pushing a Docker Image to a Self-Hosted Registry

  
Spring for Apache Kafka 2.9 Release Candidate Available

  
This Apache Maven Survival Guide is quite interesting, to me at least!]]></summary>

Research into how artificial agents can make decisions has evolved rapidly through advances in deep reinforcement learning. Compared to generative ML models like GPT-3 and Imagen, artificial agents can directly influence their environment through actions, such as moving a robot arm based on camera inputs or clicking a button in a web browser. While artificial agents have the potential to be increasingly helpful to people, current methods are held back by the need to receive detailed feedback in the form of frequently provided rewards to learn successful strategies. For example, despite large computational budgets, even powerful programs such as AlphaGo are limited to a few hundred moves until receiving their next reward.

Advances in computer vision and natural language processing continue to unlock new ways of exploring billions of images available on public and searchable websites. Today’s visual search tools make it possible to search with your camera, voice, text, images, or multiple modalities at the same time. However, it remains difficult to input subjective concepts, such as visual tones or moods, into current systems. For this reason, we have been working collaboratively with artists, photographers, and image researchers to explore how machine learning (ML) might enable people to use expressive queries as a way of visually exploring datasets.

The question of how to compile faster and smaller code arose together with the birth of modem computers. Better code optimization can significantly reduce the operational cost of large datacenter applications. The size of compiled code matters the most to mobile and embedded systems or software deployed on secure boot partitions, where the compiled binary must fit in tight code size budgets. With advances in the field, the headroom has been heavily squeezed with increasingly complicated heuristics, impeding maintenance and further improvements.  
 Recent research has shown that machine learning (ML) can unlock more opportunities in compiler optimization by replacing complicated heuri…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Elasticsearch is a very versatile platform that supports a variety of use cases and provides great flexibility around data organisation and replication strategies. This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.
When we come across users that are experiencing performance problems, it is not uncommon that this can be traced back to issue…]]></summary>
