The last few decades have witnessed the rapid development of Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology, which has evolved from an academic benchmark task used in early breakthroughs of deep learning research to tangible products available in consumer devices and to third party developers for daily use. These OCR products digitize and democratize the valuable information that is stored in paper or image-based sources (e.g., books, magazines, newspapers, forms, street signs, restaurant menus) so that they can be indexed, searched, translated, and further processed by state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques.

Last November, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative, an ambitious commitment to build a machine learning (ML) model that would support the world’s one thousand most-spoken languages, bringing greater inclusion to billions of people around the globe. However, some of these languages are spoken by fewer than twenty million people, so a core challenge is how to support languages for which there are relatively few speakers or limited available data. 

Today, we are excited to share more about the Universal Speech Model (USM), a critical first step towards supporting 1,000 languages. USM is a family of state-of-the-art speech models with 2B parameters trained on 12 million hours of speech and 28 b…]]></summary>

This is the first blog post in a series of ones to follow. Chess is a fascinating game. What can happen on those 64 squares can be a disastrous adventure or a wonderful experience. Lichess is a platform that allows you to play chess; luckily for us, it publishes all rated games as archives, starting in 2013. There are a total of over 4 billion games played. Yes, 4 billion matches.

Ingesting 4 billion documents is something that the Elastic Stack can handle easily. However, my custom Python implementation to extract and ship those documents out of Lichess faced severe performance problems. We will use Elastic APM and Universal Profiling to solve those performance problems in my custom Python application.

Let me start by saying that Elastic is an incredibly collaborative workplace. Multi…]]></summary>

Despite decades of research, we don’t see many mobile robots roaming our homes, offices, and streets. Real-world robot navigation in human-centric environments remains an unsolved problem. These challenging situations require safe and efficient navigation through tight spaces, such as squeezing between coffee tables and couches, maneuvering in tight corners, doorways, untidy rooms, and more. An equally critical requirement is to navigate in a manner that complies with unwritten social norms around people, for example, yielding at blind corners or staying at a comfortable distance.

Federated learning is a distributed way of training machine learning (ML) models where data is locally processed and only focused model updates and metrics that are intended for immediate aggregation are shared with a server that orchestrates training. This allows the training of models on locally available signals without exposing raw data to servers, increasing user privacy. In 2021, we announced that we are using federated learning to train Smart Text Selection models, an Android feature that helps users select and copy text easily by predicting what text they want to select and then automatically expanding the selection for them.

Industrial applications of machine learning are commonly composed of various items that have differing data modalities or feature distributions. Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) offer a unified view of these multimodal data systems by defining multiple types of nodes (for each data type) and edges (for the relation between data items). For instance, e-commerce networks might have [user, product, review] nodes or video platforms might have [channel, user, video, comment] nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings summarizing each node’s relationships into a vector. However, in real world HGs, there is often a label imbalance issue between different node …]]></summary>

Employee resource groups, or as we like to call them, Elastician resource groups, have been an informal part of Elastic’s culture since 2016. They started as Slack channels that any Elastician could join.

These ERGs were formalized in 2021 to ensure that the members would have structure, budget, and ultimately, a voice based on any dimension of diversity, allyship, and advocacy. This was an important step in our global diversity, equity, and inclusion journey.

Our ERGs are aligned to shared identities, interests, affinities, or allyships. The goal is to create a community of people with something in common and to encourage sharing, learning, and networking. Each has visions and goals they are working towards besides building a sense of community and belonging.

The whole point of IT systems, whether deployed via traditional methods or via modern practices (such as Agile methodologies, DevSecOps, and orchestration platforms like Kubernetes) is to make data available for business operations — those operations could be making business decisions, identifying or troubleshooting system performance and efficiency issues, detecting bad actors, or protecting organizational assets. Unfortunately, the result is a large array of disparate data silos that were never designed to interact with each other.

What’s needed is the ability to collect and ingest data from multiple disparate sources and bring them together within a common access layer, in a format that allows cross-correlation and analysis, at scale and in near real-time. Elastic provides a uniquely…]]></summary>

Imagine being able to mimic a celebrity’s look with a screenshot. Users could use the image to quickly find clothing sold online that matches the style. But, this is not the search experience of today.
Customers struggle to find what they need, and if they can’t, they'll leave. Some of them don't remember the name (keyword) of what they are looking for, but have an idea of what it looks like or the actual image. With vector search, an integrated capability in Elastic, organizations can implement similarity image search. This helps organizations create a more intuitive search experience so customers can easily search for what they are looking for with just an image.
To implement this functionality in Elastic, you don’t need to be a machine learning expert to get started. That’s because ve…]]></summary>

In its 2023 Top 10 IT Issues, Educause lists the “ultra-intelligent institution” as one of the three core building blocks of a modern IT foundation model for higher education. Colleges and universities looking to become ultra-intelligent need to move from “task-specific and silo-specific work and strategy and infrastructure to institution-wide, flexible, reusable models,” according to the article’s authors.
Taking a holistic approach to IT is a significant shift for most higher ed institutions that are often faced with silos as far as the eye can see: siloed tech tools, siloed teams, siloed budgets, and siloed resources — spread across buildings, departments, and campuses.

We also demonstrated how machine learning can help user experience practitioners improve UI quality by diagnosing tappability confusion and providing insights for improving UI design. These works along with those developed by others in the field have showcased how deep neural networks can potentially transform end user experiences and the interaction design practice.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn skills to solve decision-making tasks like playing games, enabling robots to pick up objects, or even optimizing microchip designs. However, running RL algorithms in the real world requires expensive active data collection. Pre-training on diverse datasets has proven to enable data-efficient fine-tuning for individual downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and vision problems. In the same way that BERT or GPT-3 models provide general-purpose initialization for NLP, large RL–pre-trained models could provide general-purpose initialization for decision-making.

Google’s focus on AI stems from the conviction that this transformational technology will benefit society through its capacity to assist, complement, and empower people in almost every field and sector.  In no area is the magnitude of this opportunity greater than in the spheres of healthcare and medicine.  Commensurate with our mission to demonstrate these societal benefits, Google Research’s programs in applied machine learning (ML) have helped place Alphabet among the top five most impactful corporate research institutions …]]></summary>

Many years from today, scientists will be able to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for large-scale computations with applications across science and industry. These quantum computers will be much bigger than today, consisting of millions of coherent quantum bits, or qubits. But there’s a catch — these basic building blocks must be good enough or the systems will be overrun with errors. 

Currently, the error rates of the qubits on our 3rd generation Sycamore processor are typically between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100. Through our work and that of others, we understand that developing large-scale quantum computers will require far lower error rates. We will n…]]></summary>

Many languages spoken worldwide cover numerous regional varieties (sometimes called dialects), such as Brazilian and European Portuguese or Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese. Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…]]></summary>

Differential privacy (DP) machine learning algorithms protect user data by limiting the effect of each data point on an aggregated output with a mathematical guarantee. Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. 

However, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including "unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation. For example, suppose we want to privately estimate the average of a dataset, and we know that a sphere of dia…]]></summary>

Katacoda, the popular learning platform from O’Reilly that has been helping people learn all about
Java, Docker, Kubernetes, Python, Go, C++, and more, shut down for public use in June 2022.
However, tutorials specifically for Kubernetes, linked from the Kubernetes website for our project’s
users and contributors, remained available and active after this change. Unfortunately, this will no
longer be the case, and Katacoda tutorials for learning Kubernetes will cease working after March 31st, 2023.
The Kubernetes Project wishes to thank O'Reilly Media for the many years it has supported the community
via the Katacoda learning platform. You can read more about the decision to shutter katacoda.com
on O'Reilly's own site. With this change…]]></summary>

The Google Quantum AI team is building quantum computers with superconducting microwave circuits, but much like a classical computer the superconducting processor at the heart of these computers is only part of the story. An entire technology stack of peripheral hardware is required to make the quantum computer work properly. In many cases these parts must be custom designed, requiring extensive research and development to reach the highest levels of performance.

Anomaly detection (AD), the task of distinguishing anomalies from normal data, plays a vital role in many real-world applications, such as detecting faulty products from vision sensors in manufacturing, fraudulent behaviors in financial transactions, or network security threats. Depending on the availability of the type of data — negative (normal) vs. positive (anomalous) and the availability of their labels — the task of AD involves different challenges.

(This is Part 4 in our series of posts covering different topical areas of research at Google. You can find other posts in the series here.)
   
The explosion in deep learning a decade ago was catapulted in part by the convergence of new algorithms and architectures, a marked increase in data, and access to greater compute. In the last 10 years, AI and ML models have become bigger and more sophisticated — they’re deeper, more complex, with more parameters, and trained on much more data, resulting in some of the most transformative outcomes in the history of machine learning.  
 As these models increasingly find themselves deployed in production and business applications, the efficiency and costs of these models has gon…]]></summary>
