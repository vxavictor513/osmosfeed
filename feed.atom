Pre-training visual language (VL) models on web-scale image-caption datasets has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional pre-training on image classification data. Image-caption datasets are considered to be more “open-domain” because they contain broader scene types and vocabulary words, which result in models with strong performance in few- and zero-shot recognition tasks. However, images with fine-grained class descriptions can be rare, and the class distribution can be imbalanced since image-caption datasets do not go through manual curation. By contrast, large-scale classification datasets, such as ImageNet, are often curated and can thus provide fine-…]]></summary>

For many years now, code running on the Java Platform has benefited from automatic vectorization — superword optimizations in the HotSpot C2 compiler that pack multiple scalar operations into a SIMD (Single Instruction Multiple Data) vector instruction. This is great, but these kinds of optimizations are somewhat brittle, have natural complexity limits, and are constrained by the Java Platform specification (e.g., strict ordering of floating point arithmetic). This is not to say that such optimizations are not still valuable, just that there are cases where being explicit about the shape of the code can have significantly better performance. The low-level primitive operations supporting vector search in Lucene is one such case.

Arguably, OpenTelemetry exists to (greatly) increase usage of tracing and metrics among developers. That said, logging will continue to play a critical role in providing flexible, application-specific, event-driven data. Further, OpenTelemetry has the potential to bring added value to existing application logging flows:

Common metadata across tracing, metrics, and logging to facilitate contextual correlation, including metadata passed between services as part of REST or RPC APIs; this is a critical element of service observability in the age of distributed, horizontally scaled systems

An optional unified data path for tracing, metrics, and logging to facilitate common tooling and signal routing to your observability backend

The recent progress in generative AI unlocked the possibility of creating new content in several different domains, including text, vision and audio. These models often rely on the fact that raw data is first converted to a compressed format as a sequence of tokens. In the case of audio, neural audio codecs (e.g., SoundStream or EnCodec) can efficiently compress waveforms to a compact representation, which can be inverted to reconstruct an approximation of the original audio signal. Such a representation consists of a sequence of discrete audio tokens, capturing the local properties of sounds (e.g., phonemes) and their temporal structure (e.g., prosody). By re…]]></summary>

Serverless and AWS ECS Fargate
AWS Fargate is a serverless pay-as-you-go engine used for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to run Docker containers without having to manage servers or clusters. The goal of Fargate is to containerize your application and specify the OS, CPU and memory, networking, and IAM policies needed for launch. Additionally, AWS Fargate can be used with Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in a similar manner.

Although the provisioning of servers would be handled by a third party, the need to understand the health and performance of containers within your serverless environment becomes even more vital in identifying root causes and system interruptions. Serverless still requires observability. Elastic Observability can provide observability for not only AWS ECS wit…]]></summary>

What a time it is for data and the UK Ministry of Defence (MoD), with large language models (LLMs) and artificial intelligence (AI) innovation accelerating at unprecedented speed. 

How quickly can the MoD take operational advantage of these advancements?

Now is the time to unleash the power of data and transform how the MoD approaches cybersecurity to outpace adversaries, gain multi-domain operational efficiency, and of course, attain rapid decision-making superiority. 

We know cybersecurity is a data problem. We know operational observability is a data problem, and we know mission search is also a data problem. This brings me to the punch line: these are all data problems. And the most common form that these use cases tackle is unstructured data — that is, open source intelligence and troves of data in hard-to-reach places. Elastic, because of its foundation as a search platform, has been especially instrumental in helping solve these use cases for the MoD and government.]]></summary>

Once upon a time, not so long ago, the world was a different place. The idea of a "smartphone" was still a novelty, and the mobile phone was primarily a tool for making calls and, perhaps, sending the occasional text message. Yes, we had "smart" phones, but they were simpler, mostly geared toward business users and mostly used for, well, phone stuff. Web browsing? It was there, but light, not something you'd do for hours.

In 2007, a giant wave crashed onto the shores of our everyday lives, and the world has never been the same since. This wave was the iPhone. Despite being initially met with a blend of excitement, skepticism, and even downright dismissal (remember BlackBerry's response?), the iPhone quickly became a societal game-changer.

Imagine you’re shown two identical objects and then asked to close your eyes. When you open your eyes, you see the same two objects in the same position. How can you determine if they have been swapped back and forth? Intuition and the laws of quantum mechanics agree: If the objects are truly identical, there is no way to tell. 



While this sounds like common sense, it only applies to our familiar three-dimensional world. Researchers have predicted that for a special type of particle, called an anyon, that is restricted to move only in a two-dimensional (2D) plane, quantum mechanics allows for something quite different.

The proliferation of large diffusion models for image generation has led to a significant increase in model size and inference workloads. On-device ML inference in mobile environments requires meticulous performance optimization and consideration of trade-offs due to resource constraints. Running inference of large diffusion models (LDMs) on-device, driven by the need for cost efficiency and user privacy, presents even greater challenges due to the substantial memory requirements and computational demands of these models.

People have the remarkable ability to take in a tremendous amount of information (estimated to be ~1010 bits/s entering the retina) and selectively attend to a few task-relevant and interesting regions for further processing (e.g., memory, comprehension, action). Modeling human attention (the result of which is often called a saliency model) has therefore been of interest across the fields of neuroscience, psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer vision. The ability to predict which regions are likely to attract attention has numerous important applications in areas like graphics, photography, image compression and processing, and the measurement of visual quali…]]></summary>

In the last few years, text-to-image generation research has seen an explosion of breakthroughs (notably, Imagen, Parti, DALL-E 2, etc.) that have naturally permeated into related topics. In particular, text-guided image editing (TGIE) is a practical task that involves editing generated and photographed visuals rather than completely redoing them. Quick, automated, and controllable editing is a convenient solution when recreating visuals would be time-consuming or infeasible (e.g., tweaking objects in vacation photos or perfecting fine-grained details on a cute pup generated from scratch). Further, TGIE represents a substantial opportunity to improve training of foundational models themselves. Multimodal mode…]]></summary>

Overview
 
When we get into the nuts and bolts of implementing a disaster recovery (DR) plan, an important step is to evaluate the tech stack that’s hosting the critical applications. The techstack oftentimes determines the order of operations and execution needed to effect the DR. Most organizations have the following tech stack pattern for their data centers:]]></summary>

Previously, we presented the 1,000 languages initiative and the Universal Speech Model with the goal of making speech and language technologies available to billions of users around the world. Part of this commitment involves developing high-quality speech synthesis technologies, which build upon projects such as VDTTS and AudioLM, for users that speak many different languages.

Recent advances in video conferencing have significantly improved remote video communication through features like live captioning and noise cancellation. However, there are various situations where dynamic visual augmentation would be useful to better convey complex and nuanced information. For example, when discussing what to order at a Japanese restaurant, your friends could share visuals that would help you feel more confident about ordering the “Sukiyaki”. Or when talking about your recent family trip to San Francisco, you may want to show a photo from your personal album.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a well-established technology that is widely adopted for various applications such as conference calls, streamed video transcription and voice commands. While the challenges for this technology are centered around noisy audio inputs, the visual stream in multimodal videos (e.g., TV, online edited videos) can provide strong cues for improving the robustness of ASR systems — this is called audiovisual ASR (AV-ASR).
 

Although lip motion can provide strong signals for speech recognition and is the most common area of focus for AV-ASR, the mouth is often not directly visible in videos in the wild (e.g., due to egocentric viewpoints, face coverings, and low resolution…]]></summary>

Large-scale models, such as T5, GPT-3, PaLM, Flamingo and PaLI, have demonstrated the ability to store substantial amounts of knowledge when scaled to tens of billions of parameters and trained on large text and image datasets. These models achieve state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering and open vocabulary recognition. Despite such achievements, these models require a massive volume of data for training and end up with a tremendous number of parameters (billions in many cases), resulting in significant computational requirements. Moreover, the data used to train these models can become outdated, requiring re-training…]]></summary>

Software isn’t created in one dramatic step. It improves bit by bit, one little step at a time — editing, running unit tests, fixing build errors, addressing code reviews, editing some more, appeasing linters, and fixing more errors — until finally it becomes good enough to merge into a code repository. Software engineering isn’t an isolated process, but a dialogue among human developers, code reviewers, bug reporters, software architects and tools, such as compilers, unit tests, linters and static analyzers.
