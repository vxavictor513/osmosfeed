Differential privacy (DP) machine learning algorithms protect user data by limiting the effect of each data point on an aggregated output with a mathematical guarantee. Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. 

However, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including "unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation. For example, suppose we want to privately estimate the average of a dataset, and we know that a sphere of dia…]]></summary>

We believe that distributing more of our key security components to the masses and highlighting their inner workings will greatly enhance our product and provide a tangible benefit to researchers and practitioners alike.

Financial institutions have vast amounts of data about their customers, but many of them struggle to use that data to their advantage. Data may be sitting in silos or trapped on costly mainframes. Customers may only have access to a limited quantity of data, and service providers may need to search through multiple systems of record to handle a simple customer inquiry. This creates a hazard for providers and a headache for customers. 
Elastic and Google Cloud enable institutions to manage this information effectively. Powerful search tools allow data to be surfaced faster than ever — whether it's card payments, ACH (Automated Clearing House), wires, bank transfers, real-time payments, or another payment method. This information can be correlated to customer profiles, cash balances, merch…]]></summary>

However, tutorials specifically for Kubernetes, linked from the Kubernetes website for our project’s

longer be the case, and Katacoda tutorials for learning Kubernetes will cease working after March 31st, 2023.

What is Strava and why is it the focus? Strava is a platform where athletes, from recreational to professional, can share their activities. All my fitness data from my Apple Watch, Garmin, and Zwift is automatically synced and saved there. It is safe to say that if I want to get an overview of my fitness, getting the data out of Strava is the first step.
Why do this with the Elastic Stack? I want to ask my data questions, and questions are just searches!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
When thinking about holistic end-to-end observability, it can help to start with what you already have. Many government agencies are already strategically ingesting and storing logs — a key component of observability. 
More than a year and a half after the release of M-21-31, US government agencies continue to work through the logging maturity models outlined in the memorandum. One of the key messages in M-21-31 is the need to keep log data actionable for longer time periods to help detect and mitigate hidden attacks and avoid situations like the SolarWinds breach of 2021.
As agencies examine the capabilities of their logging solutions in light of M-21-31, that actionable data is crucial. Compared with other solutions, Elastic Observability offers faster access to historical data. With E…]]></summary>

The Google Quantum AI team is building quantum computers with superconducting microwave circuits, but much like a classical computer the superconducting processor at the heart of these computers is only part of the story. An entire technology stack of peripheral hardware is required to make the quantum computer work properly. In many cases these parts must be custom designed, requiring extensive research and development to reach the highest levels of performance.

Anomaly detection (AD), the task of distinguishing anomalies from normal data, plays a vital role in many real-world applications, such as detecting faulty products from vision sensors in manufacturing, fraudulent behaviors in financial transactions, or network security threats. Depending on the availability of the type of data — negative (normal) vs. positive (anomalous) and the availability of their labels — the task of AD involves different challenges.

The explosion in deep learning a decade ago was catapulted in part by the convergence of new algorithms and architectures, a marked increase in data, and access to greater compute. In the last 10 years, AI and ML models have become bigger and more sophisticated — they’re deeper, more complex, with more parameters, and trained on much more data, resulting in some of the most transformative outcomes in the history of machine learning.  
 As these models increasingly find themselves deployed in production and business applications, the efficiency and costs of these models has gon…]]></summary>

With more and more applications moving to the cloud, an increasing amount of telemetry data (logs, metrics, traces) is being collected, which can help improve application performance, operational efficiencies, and business KPIs. However, analyzing this data is extremely tedious and time consuming given the tremendous amounts of data being generated. Traditional methods of alerting and simple pattern matching (visual or simple searching etc) are not sufficient for IT Operations teams and SREs. It’s like trying to find a needle in a haystack. 

In this blog post, we’ll cover some of Elastic’s artificial intelligence for IT operations (AIOps) and machine learning (ML) capabilities for root cause analysis.

This is the fourth blog post in our Strava series (don’t forget to catch up on the first, second, and third)! I will take you through a journey of data onboarding, manipulation, and visualization.

What is Strava, and why is it the focus? Strava is a platform where recreational and professional athletes can share their activities. All my fitness data from my Apple Watch, Garmin, and Zwift is automatically synced and saved. Getting the data out of Strava is the first step to getting an overview of my fitness.

In the last blog posts, we developed a script that imports all the data from Strava. Now it’s time for some observability and identifying issues with our script.
What is my script doing?
Remember, in the second blog, we wrote quite an extensive script. I will post it here again:

The Kubernetes project runs a community-owned image registry called registry.k8s.io to host its container images. On the 3rd of April 2023, the old registry k8s.gcr.io will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related subprojects will be pushed to the old registry.
This registry registry.k8s.io replaced the old one and has been generally available for several months. We have published a blog post about its benefits to the community and the Kubernetes project. This post also announced that future versions of Kubernetes will not be available in the old registry. Now that time has come.

   As global temperatures rise, wildfires around the world are becoming more frequent and more dangerous. Their effects are felt by many communities as people evacuate their homes or suffer harm even from proximity to the fire and smoke.  

As part of Google’s mission to help people access trusted information in critical moments, we use satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) to track wildfires and inform affected communities. Our wildfire tracker was recently expanded. It provides updated fire boundary information every 10–15 minutes, is more accurate than similar satellite products, and improves on our previous work. These boundaries are shown for large fires in the continental US, Mexico, and most of Cana…]]></summary>

Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer
(human or piece of software) to make the right decision. In the context of Kubernetes,
having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial.
SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools
that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server,
scheduler, kubelet and kube-controller-manager.
In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed,
SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman,
and Han Kang, chairs of SIG Instrumentation,
on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute.

Language models are now capable of performing many new natural language processing (NLP) tasks by reading instructions, often that they hadn’t seen before. The ability to reason on new tasks is mostly credited to training models on a wide variety of unique instructions, known as “instruction tuning”, which was introduced by FLAN and extended in T0, Super-Natural Instructions, MetaICL, and InstructGPT. However, much of the data that drives these advances remain unreleased to the broader research community. 
    
In “The Flan Collection: Designing Data and Methods for Effective Instruction Tuning”, we closely examine and release a newer and more extensive publicly ava…]]></summary>

In many computing applications the system needs to make decisions to serve requests that arrive in an online fashion. Consider, for instance, the example of a navigation app that responds to driver requests. In such settings there is inherent uncertainty about important aspects of the problem. For example, the preferences of the driver with respect to features of the route are often unknown and the delays of road segments can be uncertain. The field of online machine learning studies such settings and provides various techniques for decision-making problems under uncertainty.

Today many people have digital access to their medical records, including their doctor’s clinical notes. However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts. For example, a doctor might write in their clinical notes, “pt referred to pt for lbp“, which is meant to convey the statement: “Patient referred to physical therapy for low back pain.”  Coming up with this translation is tough for laypeople and compu…]]></summary>
