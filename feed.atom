The mechanism uses a mutating webhook, which is a standard Kubernetes component, but you don’t need to know all the details to use the Attacher. Essentially, you can install the Attacher, add one annotation to any Kubernetes deployment that has an application you want monitored, and that’s it!

In this blog, we’ll walk through a full example from scratch using a Java application. Apart from the Java code and using a JVM for the application, everything else works the same for the other languages supported by the Attacher.

With 5G networks, the reliance on open, standardized IT technologies and cloud-native approaches like containerization heightens the risks of cyber attacks, as these systems often have broader exposure to known and 0 day threats. The integration of AI and IoT within this new architecture further amplifies the security challenges and puts pressure on having robust and advanced security measures for telecom operators.

for better troubleshooting of Kubernetes and to empower developers to enhance Kubernetes.
What is contextual logging?
Contextual logging
is based on the go-logr API.
The key idea is that libraries are passed a logger instance by their caller
and use that for logging instead of accessing a global logger.
The binary decides the logging implementation, not the libraries.

A recent wave of video generation models has burst onto the scene, in many cases showcasing stunning picturesque quality. One of the current bottlenecks in video generation is in the ability to produce coherent large motions. In many cases, even the current leading models either generate small motion or, when producing larger motions, exhibit noticeable artifacts.
 

To explore the application of language models in video generation, we introduce VideoPoet (website, research paper), a large language model (LLM) that is capable of a wide variety of video generation tasks, including text-to-video, image-to-video, video stylization, video inpainting and outpainting, and video-to-audio.

Fifteen minutes. That’s how long it took to empty the Colosseum, an engineering marvel that’s still standing as the largest amphitheater in the world. Two thousand years later, this design continues to work well to move enormous crowds out of sporting and entertainment venues.





But of course, exiting the arena is only the first step. Next, people must navigate the traffic that builds up in the surrounding streets. This is an age-old problem that remains unsolved to this day. In Rome, they addressed the issue by prohibiting private traffic on the street that passes directly by the Colosseum. This policy worked there, but what if you’re not in Rome? What if you’re at the Superbowl? Or at a Taylor Swift concert?
