The proliferation of large diffusion models for image generation has led to a significant increase in model size and inference workloads. On-device ML inference in mobile environments requires meticulous performance optimization and consideration of trade-offs due to resource constraints. Running inference of large diffusion models (LDMs) on-device, driven by the need for cost efficiency and user privacy, presents even greater challenges due to the substantial memory requirements and computational demands of these models.
 

We address this challenge in our work titled “Speed Is All You Need: On-Device Acceleration of Large Diffusion Models via GPU-Aware Optimizations” (to be presented at the CVPR 20…]]></summary>

Last week, I wanted to find out the process for my fifteen year old daughter to get her first driver's license. Sounds simple enough. However, I ended up spending a good portion of my weekend searching for definitive answers — navigating multiple websites, without the option of asking a real, live person. In the very near future, I'll simply be able to ask a chatbot. The chatbot, using its natural language model trained on relevant government data, would provide a simple, step-by-step guide, explaining the entire process, required documents, and applicable fees.

Organizations are becoming increasingly more reliant on data to make effective, evidence-based decisions to drive business outcomes. Whether this be assessing market conditions and improving customer experience, ensuring application uptime, or securing an organization, data from multiple sources — including consumers and internal systems — is critical to day-to-day operations. 

This data-driven approach requires organizations to collect, store, and analyze mountainous volumes of data at speed for timely decision making. Often this means performing correlation and analysis across multiple sources and formats of varying degrees of complexity at scale.

In Elasticsearch 8.8, we’re introducing the reroute processor in technical preview that makes it possible to send documents, such as logs, to different data streams, according to flexible routing rules. When using Elastic Observability, this gives you more granular control over your data with regard to retention, permissions, and processing with all the potential benefits of the data stream naming scheme. While optimized for data streams, the reroute processor also works with classic indices. This blog post contains examples on how to use the reroute processor that you can try on your own by executing the snippets in the Kibana dev tools.

People have the remarkable ability to take in a tremendous amount of information (estimated to be ~1010 bits/s entering the retina) and selectively attend to a few task-relevant and interesting regions for further processing (e.g., memory, comprehension, action). Modeling human attention (the result of which is often called a saliency model) has therefore been of interest across the fields of neuroscience, psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer vision.

Given the increasing frequency, tempo, and sophistication of cyber attacks, it's more important than ever that organizations take a proactive approach to protecting their sensitive data and assets. One of the most critical elements of effective cybersecurity is openness. An open approach to cybersecurity means being transparent, sharing knowledge, and collaborating to build more robust defenses against threats.

It's common practice in the cybersecurity market to provide customers with a “black box” tool and ask them to trust its capabilities to protect them. In contrast to other security tools, Elastic Security takes an open and transparent approach, which allows you to peek behind the scenes, understand how our instrumentation works, collaborate with us, and influence the product devel…]]></summary>

The recently announced Elasticsearch Relevance EngineTM (ESRETM) contains a package of important capabilities that supercharge search and make it possible to query Elasticsearch® with the same natural language you use to ask generative AI questions. 

This got me wondering how we can use this for logs. It is fairly easy to get started with the Elastic Learned Sparse Encoder model, an important ESRE capability that enables semantic search — we will go through how to use it for logging in this blog. This capability is significantly different from Elasticsearch®’s current capabilities because it understands a word's meaning and searches broadly across words that have similar meaning or are synonymous to the words I searched for.

The transition from on-premises infrastructure to cloud environments is no longer just an option, but a necessity for businesses seeking to stay competitive in a rapidly evolving digital world. A well-executed cloud migration strategy can deliver compelling benefits like enhanced flexibility, scalability, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. However, the journey to the cloud is often complex and presents several challenges, making it crucial for organizations to understand the entire migration process and prepare adequately.

Cloud migration typically follows a distinct set of phases, each with its unique objectives and potential hurdles. These include:

In the last few years, text-to-image generation research has seen an explosion of breakthroughs (notably, Imagen, Parti, DALL-E 2, etc.) that have naturally permeated into related topics. In particular, text-guided image editing (TGIE) is a practical task that involves editing generated and photographed visuals rather than completely redoing them. Quick, automated, and controllable editing is a convenient solution when recreating visuals would be time-consuming or infeasible (e.g., tweaking objects in vacation photos or perfecting fine-grained details on a cute pup generated from scratch). Further, TGIE represents a substantial opportunity to improve training of foundational models themselves. Multimodal mode…]]></summary>

Recent advances in video conferencing have significantly improved remote video communication through features like live captioning and noise cancellation. However, there are various situations where dynamic visual augmentation would be useful to better convey complex and nuanced information. For example, when discussing what to order at a Japanese restaurant, your friends could share visuals that would help you feel more confident about ordering the “Sukiyaki”. Or when talking about your recent family trip to San Francisco, you may want to show a photo from your personal album.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a well-established technology that is widely adopted for various applications such as conference calls, streamed video transcription and voice commands. While the challenges for this technology are centered around noisy audio inputs, the visual stream in multimodal videos (e.g., TV, online edited videos) can provide strong cues for improving the robustness of ASR systems — this is called audiovisual ASR (AV-ASR).
 

Although lip motion can provide strong signals for speech recognition and is the most common area of focus for AV-ASR, the mouth is often not directly visible in videos in the wild (e.g., due to egocentric viewpoints, face coverings, and low resolution…]]></summary>

Large-scale models, such as T5, GPT-3, PaLM, Flamingo and PaLI, have demonstrated the ability to store substantial amounts of knowledge when scaled to tens of billions of parameters and trained on large text and image datasets. These models achieve state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering and open vocabulary recognition. Despite such achievements, these models require a massive volume of data for training and end up with a tremendous number of parameters (billions in many cases), resulting in significant computational requirements. Moreover, the data used to train these models can become outdated, requiring re-training…]]></summary>

Software isn’t created in one dramatic step. It improves bit by bit, one little step at a time — editing, running unit tests, fixing build errors, addressing code reviews, editing some more, appeasing linters, and fixing more errors — until finally it becomes good enough to merge into a code repository. Software engineering isn’t an isolated process, but a dialogue among human developers, code reviewers, bug reporters, software architects and tools, such as compilers, unit tests, linters and static analyzers.

Creating robots that exhibit robust and dynamic locomotion capabilities, similar to animals or humans, has been a long-standing goal in the robotics community. In addition to completing tasks quickly and efficiently, agility allows legged robots to move through complex environments that are otherwise difficult to traverse. Researchers at Google have been pursuing agility for multiple years and across various form factors. Yet, while researchers have enabled robots to hike or jump over some obstacles, there is still no generally accepted benchmark that comprehensively measures robot agility or mobility. In contrast, benchmarks are driving forces behind the development of machine learning, such as ImageNet for computer…]]></summary>

Clustering is a central problem in unsupervised machine learning (ML) with many applications across domains in both industry and academic research more broadly. At its core, clustering consists of the following problem: given a set of data elements, the goal is to partition the data elements into groups such that similar objects are in the same group, while dissimilar objects are in different groups. This problem has been studied in math, computer science, operations research and statistics for more than 60 years in its myriad variants. Two common forms of clustering are metric clustering, in which the elements are points in a metric space, like in the k-means problem, and grap…]]></summary>

Wednesday, May 10th was an exciting day for the Google Research community as we watched the results of months and years of our foundational and applied work get announced on the Google I/O stage. With the quick pace of announcements on stage, it can be difficult to convey the substantial effort and unique innovations that underlie the technologies we presented. So today, we’re excited to reveal more about the research efforts behind some of the many compelling announcements at this year's I/O.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) makes managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles within Kubernetes easier than ever. It allows cluster
administrators to define the profiles in a predefined custom resource YAML,
which then gets distributed by the SPO into the whole cluster. Modification and
removal of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,
but that’s a small subset of its capabilities.
Another core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles. This
means that users can define a baseProfileName in the YAML specification, which
then gets automatically resolved by the operator and combines the syscall rules.
If a base profile has another baseProfileName, then the operator will
recursively resolve the profiles up to a ce…]]></summary>

Code-change reviews are a critical part of the software development process at scale, taking a significant amount of the code authors’ and the code reviewers’ time. As part of this process, the reviewer inspects the proposed code and asks the author for code changes through comments written in natural language. At Google, we see millions of reviewer comments per year, and authors require an average of ~60 minutes active shepherding time between sending changes for review and finally submitting the change. In our measurements, the required active work time that the code author must do to address reviewer comments grows almost linearly with the number of comme…]]></summary>

Anyone who has ever stood up or experimented with OpenStack knows that this is a tall order. Imagine having to stand up that platform over and over again on a daily basis. My focus was to find a way—a tool—that could help me do that, so I could focus on helping solve the customers' true challenges.

Large machine learning (ML) models are ubiquitous in modern applications: from spam filters to recommender systems and virtual assistants. These models achieve remarkable performance partially due to the abundance of available training data. However, these data can sometimes contain private information, including personal identifiable information, copyright material, etc. Therefore, protecting the privacy of the training data is critical to practical, applied ML.  



Differential Privacy (DP) is one of the most widely accepted technologies that allows reasoning about data anonymization in a formal way. In the context of an ML model, DP can guarantee that each individual user's contribution will …]]></summary>
