Many years from today, scientists will be able to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for large-scale computations with applications across science and industry. These quantum computers will be much bigger than today, consisting of millions of coherent quantum bits, or qubits. But there’s a catch — these basic building blocks must be good enough or the systems will be overrun with errors. 

Currently, the error rates of the qubits on our 3rd generation Sycamore processor are typically between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100. Through our work and that of others, we understand that developing large-scale quantum computers will require far lower error rates. We will n…]]></summary>

After six years in the accounting department of a staffing company, Alexis Young realized she was good at her job, but it didn’t fulfill her. 
She pivoted her career path into HR in 2012 and joined Elastic as Senior HR Business Partner in 2022. Her role requires her to partner closely with her respective leadership team and the business to work through HR-related issues as they come up. 
“I’m the front-line person,” Alexis says. “It could be as simple as directing employees  to our HR shared service team and partnering on business objectives and coaching and supporting employees through various HR matters.

Vulnerability management (VM) is a challenging task. Of the three pillars of people, process, and technology, it is the latter that we have the most control over and that can make the greatest impact. We recognize that technology alone is not sufficient and must be accompanied by strong processes and skilled personnel. However, the right technology can greatly facilitate and improve the effectiveness of our vulnerability management efforts.

In this blog post, we will illustrate the value of the Elastic Stack as a data management platform for vulnerability management and demonstrate how we have fully automated the process of retrieving, enriching, and disseminating scan results to various teams.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
Have you ever heard the saying "cooking is like science"? Well, the same could be said for machine learning. Just like cooking, building a machine learning (ML) pipeline requires a series of precise steps, a dash of creativity, and a good understanding of the ingredients you're working with.
Don't have the time, skills, or knowledge? Or are you tired of spending hours in the kitchen chopping, mixing, and blending ingredients by hand? Imagine being able to automate the entire cooking process with the push of a button. That's what you can do with an Elastic ML supervised learning job!
Just like a cooking food processor, the machine learning pipeline in Elasticsearch streamlines the process of making accurate predictions and automating decision-making. This blog post will take a closer look…]]></summary>

This is the sixth blog post in our Strava series (don’t forget to catch up on the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth)! I will take you through data onboarding, manipulation, and visualization.

What is Strava, and why is it the focus? Strava is a platform where recreational and professional athletes can share their activities. All my fitness data from my Apple Watch, Garmin, and Zwift is automatically synced and saved. Getting the data out of Strava is the first step to get an overview of my fitness.

This time we take a look at some of our newest features in the machine learning space.

In the past few releases, we introduced many features related to machine learning. From importing custom models to out-of-the-box functions such as explain log rate spikes.

Many languages spoken worldwide cover numerous regional varieties (sometimes called dialects), such as Brazilian and European Portuguese or Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese. Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…]]></summary>

Organizations (and people) work their way up it, one step at a time (it’s the black line in the graph below). But there’s rarely a continuous learning curve. Instead, it’s often interrupted by leaps. The moments when both feet need to leave the ground in order to get from here to there. These red boxes feel like brick walls (until we realize that they are our chance to leap.)]]></summary>

The goal of a customer success manager (CSM) is in the title — to help customers succeed.
At Elastic, CSMs are trusted advisors to our clients. They act as the bridge between the customer and Elastic to help solve problems, offer solutions, and integrate Elastic technologies into a client’s existing infrastructure.
But, these roles are relatively new. With widespread public cloud adoption, companies have changed how they look at IT spending. Instead of focusing on long-term expenses (CAPEX), they are focused on operating expenses (OPEX). They want to maximize their return on software and technology investments. Which is where CSM’s come in.
Elastic CSMs aren’t involved in the sales process — this sets us apart from CSMs at other companies. Here at Elastic, they work with the account team…]]></summary>

Since 8.0 and the release of third-party natural language processing (NLP) models for text embeddings, users of the Elastic Stack have access to a wide variety of models to embed their text documents and perform query-based information retrieval using vector search.
Given all these components and their parameters, and depending on the text corpus you want to search in, it can be overwhelming to choose which settings will give the best search relevance.
In this series of blog posts, we will introduce a number of tests we ran using various publicly available data sets and information retrieval techniques that are available in the Elastic Stack. We’ll then provide recommendations of the best techniques to use depending on the setup.

Managing and maintaining the configuration of Elasticsearch for your specific use case and application, through various continuous integration and delivery steps, is a hard task. It often requires “init steps” in your infrastructure as code processes, such as creating specific application-related users, roles, data retention and backup policies, and often dealing with RESTful API calls and misconfigurations that might happen along the way.
This is why we’re excited to introduce a new type of Custom Resource (CRD) to Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) — Elastic Stack Configuration Policies. This new policy CRD allows you to explicitly configure Elasticsearch clusters managed by ECK.

Differential privacy (DP) machine learning algorithms protect user data by limiting the effect of each data point on an aggregated output with a mathematical guarantee. Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. 

However, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including "unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation. For example, suppose we want to privately estimate the average of a dataset, and we know that a sphere of dia…]]></summary>

The explosion in deep learning a decade ago was catapulted in part by the convergence of new algorithms and architectures, a marked increase in data, and access to greater compute. In the last 10 years, AI and ML models have become bigger and more sophisticated — they’re deeper, more complex, with more parameters, and trained on much more data, resulting in some of the most transformative outcomes in the history of machine learning.  
 As these models increasingly find themselves deployed in production and business applications, the efficiency and costs of these models has gon…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes project runs a community-owned image registry called registry.k8s.io to host its container images. On the 3rd of April 2023, the old registry k8s.gcr.io will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related subprojects will be pushed to the old registry.
This registry registry.k8s.io replaced the old one and has been generally available for several months. We have published a blog post about its benefits to the community and the Kubernetes project. This post also announced that future versions of Kubernetes will not be available in the old registry. Now that time has come.

   As global temperatures rise, wildfires around the world are becoming more frequent and more dangerous. Their effects are felt by many communities as people evacuate their homes or suffer harm even from proximity to the fire and smoke.  

As part of Google’s mission to help people access trusted information in critical moments, we use satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) to track wildfires and inform affected communities. Our wildfire tracker was recently expanded. It provides updated fire boundary information every 10–15 minutes, is more accurate than similar satellite products, and improves on our previous work. These boundaries are shown for large fires in the continental US, Mexico, and most of Cana…]]></summary>

Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer
(human or piece of software) to make the right decision. In the context of Kubernetes,
having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial.
SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools
that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server,
scheduler, kubelet and kube-controller-manager.
In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed,
SIG ContribEx-Comms tech lead talked with Elana Hashman,
and Han Kang, chairs of SIG Instrumentation,
on how the SIG is organized, what are the current challenges and how anyone can get involved and contribute.

Language models are now capable of performing many new natural language processing (NLP) tasks by reading instructions, often that they hadn’t seen before. The ability to reason on new tasks is mostly credited to training models on a wide variety of unique instructions, known as “instruction tuning”, which was introduced by FLAN and extended in T0, Super-Natural Instructions, MetaICL, and InstructGPT. However, much of the data that drives these advances remain unreleased to the broader research community.

In many computing applications the system needs to make decisions to serve requests that arrive in an online fashion. Consider, for instance, the example of a navigation app that responds to driver requests. In such settings there is inherent uncertainty about important aspects of the problem. For example, the preferences of the driver with respect to features of the route are often unknown and the delays of road segments can be uncertain. The field of online machine learning studies such settings and provides various techniques for decision-making problems under uncertainty.

Today many people have digital access to their medical records, including their doctor’s clinical notes. However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts. For example, a doctor might write in their clinical notes, “pt referred to pt for lbp“, which is meant to convey the statement: “Patient referred to physical therapy for low back pain.”  Coming up with this translation is tough for laypeople and compu…]]></summary>

(This is Part 2 in our series of posts covering different topical areas of research at Google. You can find other posts in the series here.)
 
The last year showed tremendous breakthroughs in artificial intelligence (AI), particularly in large language models (LLMs) and text-to-image models. These technological advances require that we are thoughtful and intentional in how they are developed and deployed. In this blogpost, we share ways we have approached Responsible AI across our research in the past year and where we’re headed in 2023. We highlight four primary themes covering foundational and socio-technical research, applied research, and product solutions, as part of our commitment to b…]]></summary>
