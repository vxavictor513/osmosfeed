I put together a Spring Tipds video introducing some of the major themes of Spring Framework 6 / Spring Boot 3. 


I also did an in-depth look at the new GraalVM support powered by Spring’s ahead-of-time (AOT) engine.

        <link href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/11/29/spring-integration-6-0-goes-ga"/>
        <updated>2022-11-29T17:55:29.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Spring community,



On behalf of the team, it is my very great pleasure to announce that Spring Integration 6.0.0 is now generally available and can be found in Maven Central.



This release is the culmination of more than a year of work.
A massive thank you to everyone that has contributed, and to all the early adopters that have been providing vital feedback on the milestones.



This version is fully based on Spring Framework 6.0, Spring Data 2022.0, Spring for GraphQL 1.1, Spring WebServices 4.0 and many other major releases of Spring portfolio projects which contribute to their respective integration modules.
On the other hand Spring Integration 6.0 is a part of recently released Spring Boot 3.0.



Highlights of the new release include:





A Java 17 baseline



Support for native images with GraalVM and Spring AOT engine



Observability instrumentation with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing



Support for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline





There’s far too many features to list them all here in detail, so head over to the What’s New documentation page and check out a Migration Guide on GitHub.
If you just want to get started, you can easily bootstrap a new project on start.spring.io.
If you’d like to try out the GraalVM support, start.spring.io can help with that too.



Cheers, 

Artem

In recent years, language models (LMs) have become more prominent in natural language processing (NLP) research and are also becoming increasingly impactful in practice. Scaling up LMs has been shown to improve performance across a range of NLP tasks. For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale. However, one of the challenges of continued scaling is that training new, larger models requires great amounts of computational resources. Moreover, new models are often trained from scratch and do not leverage the weights from previously existing mo…]]></summary>

These groups were formalized in 2021, but they’ve been a part of Elastic’s culture since 2016. By formalizing them, we’re able to ensure they all have a structure, budget, and a voice based on any dimension of diversity, identity, allyship, and advocacy. This was an important step in our global diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy. 
Each ERG has their own mission and goals, but as a whole they want to create community and belonging around shared interests and experiences.

What is Strava and why is it the focus? Strava is a platform where athletes, from recreational to professional, can share their activities. All my fitness data from my Apple Watch, Garmin, and Zwift is automatically synced and saved there. It is safe to say that if I want to get an overview of my fitness, getting the data out of Strava is the first step.

Why do this with the Elastic Stack? I want to ask my data questions, and questions are just searches!

Starting with Kubernetes 1.25, our container image registry has changed from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io. This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers & Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.
In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).

The release concludes the integration of the Moduliths project into the Spring ecosystem. I want to especially thank Dmitry Belyaev and Björn Kieling who helped a lot during the migration and contributed significant new features to the project, the event publication repository implementations for JDBC and MongoDB in particular.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of the team, it is my very great pleasure to announce that Spring Boot 3.0 is now generally available and 3.0.0 can be found in Maven Central.

This release is the culmination of 12 months work and over 5700 commits by 151 different individuals. A massive thank you to everyone that has contributed, and to all the early adopters that have been providing vital feedback on the milestones.

This is the first major revision of Spring Boot since 2.0 was released 4.5 years ago. It’s also the first GA version of Spring Boot that provides support for Spring Framework 6.0 and GraalVM. 

Highlights of the new release include:


  
A Java 17 baseline

  
Support for generating native images with GraalVM, superseding the experimental Spring Native project

  
Improved observability with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing

  
Support for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline


There’s far too many features to list them all here in detail, so head over to the release notes page on our wiki to find out more. If you just want to get started, you can easily bootstrap a new project on start.spring.io. If you’d like to try out the GraalVM support, start.spring.io can help with that too.

Over the coming weeks we’ll be publishing blog posts that cover some Spring Boot 3.0 features in detail.

Thanks again to everyone that has contributed to Spring and Spring Boot over the years! Supporting Jakarta EE 9 and 10, the observability enhancements, and GraalVM support has been a huge team effort that has left no corner of the Spring portfolio untouched. A special thank you to the developers of the other projects in the Spring portfolio, without whom this release would not have been possible.

End of life

It’s just over a year since the release of Spring Boot 2.6.0 which means that, as per our open source support policy, 2.6.14 is the last release that’s planned in the 2.6.x line. Releases may be made in the future, but only in response to a commercial support request.

As previously announced, Spring Boot 2.7 will be the last minor in the 2.x line. As such, we’ve extended our open source support for 2.7.x release by an additional 6 months until November 2023. In addition, commercial support for Spring Boot 2.7 has also been extended and is available until February 2025.

Spring Boot 3 is here (or will be tomorrow, on the 24th of November, 2022, to be more precise!), bringing a fantastic new Ahead-of-Time (AOT) compilation engine that supports GraalVM native images. Join me, and we’ll dive deep into the engine and its interactions with the Spring component model. 

This video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about.

Spring Boot 3, I’ve written about in abundance so I won’t rehash that. If you want to learn more about some of the amazing new features in Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, perhaps check out my Spring Tips installment introducing them in this episode:


And, of course, a major new feature in Spring Boot 3 is the new ahead-of-time (AOT) engine, about which I speak at great length in tomorrow’s new installment of Spring Tips:

You can download it from Maven Central by using the module coordinates:




implementation 'org.springframework.security:spring-security-oauth2-authorization-server:1.0.0'




Spring Authorization Server has come a long way since its initial commit on April 2, 2020, as the APIs have stabilized and matured over this time. A lot of effort and care has been put into this project to ensure a robust foundation for its continued growth. This first major release delivers a full feature set.



Spring Authorization Server 1.0 is based on Spring Security 6.0, which is based on Spring Framework 6.0 and will require a minimum of JDK 17 at runtime. This major release inherits the VMware Tanzu OSS support policy. Commercial support, which offers an extended support period, is also available from VMware.



To get started using Spring Authorization Server, see the Getting Started chapter of the reference documentation and the samples, to become familiar with setup and configuration.



On behalf of the team, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed and helped grow this project. We hope to continue to work together and ultimately establish Spring Authorization Server as the de facto framework for OAuth2 Authorization Server support on the Java platform.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Greetings Spring community,



The Spring Web Services team has released 4.0.0 for general availability. This is the version of Spring WS you’ll need if you are building SOAP-based applications with Spring Boot 3.0.



4.0.x is the generation of Spring Web Services that works with Jakarta EE 9+, the version where the enterprise specs (JAX-WS, etc.) migrate from javax. to jakarta. package prefixes. Check out Juergen Holler’s blog post for more details about Spring Framework 6.0.



Being based upon Spring Framework 6.0, this is also the generation of Spring Web Services that is rebased on top of Java 17 (LTS). So check it out!



For more details, check out our official GitHub release. This includes links to all the related tickets as well as the source code.



We have also adopted GitHub releases as our avenue for tracking changes in a given release. All current and prior releases of Spring WS are now captured in the list of releases on GitHub. Feel free to check them out.



The artifacts are hosted on Maven Central so grab 'em while they’re hot!

Many cloud deployments choose to host their applications on AWS for the globally diverse set of regions it covers and the myriad of services (for faster development and innovation) available, as well as to drive operational and capital costs down.

The Elastic Platform has long been well-regarded as an analytical system for search use cases and machine-generated data. Analytics are focused on processing data-as-ingested, where significant thought is put into how to optimally structure data as it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Kibana exposes Elasticsearch aggregations and uses them to create interactive dashboards, visualizations, and alerts.

But as the Elastic Platform is more widely adopted as a search, security, observability, and general analytics platform, analyst users require the ability to take data-as-ingested, transform it to fit their investigative needs post-ingestion, and derive insights from underlying Elasticsearch index data.

You get one shot to keep shoppers on your ecommerce website with relevant search results. According to Harris Poll, 76% of online shoppers abandon a retail website after an unsuccessful search.


Therefore, it’s critical to optimize your search experience so buyers can find what they need fast. That’s the theory behind a modern search experience: Nowadays it’s not enough to simply provide a search bar that returns matching products. Your ecommerce site must include a complete set of search tools that personally guide users to the products they want.

In this blog, you’ll learn how to start improving ecommerce search by adding two common features: scoped suggestions and query corrections, also known as “Did you mean?”

Information overload is a significant challenge for many organizations and individuals today.

This has been exacerbated by the increase in virtual work and remains a challenge as many teams transition to a hybrid work environment with a mix of those working both virtually and in an office.

On November 5, 2022, at the 2022 Alibaba Cloud Apsara Summit, Elastic won the Alibaba Cloud Product Ecosystem Partner Significant Contribution Award. This award commends and thanks the Partner of Alibaba Cloud for maintaining rapid growth despite the double test of the pandemic and the economy, to promote high-quality development themes of Alibaba cloud. Elastic is the only international partner that has won this honor.

2022 is the new beginning of the second five-year strategic cooperation between Elastic and Alibaba Cloud. The two companies will continue to deepen cooperation in products, services, communities, and ecology to achieve a new leap in high quality.
,At this conference, the two parties jointly launched the latest Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch serverless version, providing end-to-end data access, data management, data application, and visualization module component capabilities around the Elastic Stack ecological components, as well as scenario-based upper-layer application capabilities. The launch of this version can avoid the complexity of large-scale cluster operation and maintenance, and the cloud native service can achieve second-level elastic scaling without planning and managing cluster resource configuration. By optimizing the cost of computing and storage resources, it can reduce the user's usage cost by 70% on average. This version can efficiently manage and analyze massive data, by decoupling of storage and computing, effectively improve read and write efficiency, and greatly reduce database operation and maintenance management costs.

The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by the number of its parameters, and as a consequence, finding more effective ways to increase model parameters has become a trend in deep learning research. Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network. Such models have demonstrated better scaling in multiple domains and…]]></summary>

The field of natural language processing (NLP) has been revolutionized by language models trained on large amounts of text data. Scaling up the size of language models often leads to improved performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks. In many cases, the performance of a large language model can be predicted by extrapolating the performance trend of smaller models. For instance, the effect of scale on language model perplexity has been empirically shown to span more than seven orders of magnitude. 

On the other hand, performance for certain other tasks does not improve in a predictable fashion. For example, the GPT-3 paper showed that the ability of language models to perform mult…]]></summary>

Recent efforts have delivered publicly available brain maps (high-resolution 3D mapping of brain cells and their connectivities) at unprecedented quality and scale, such as H01, a 1.4 petabyte nanometer-scale digital reconstruction of a sample of human brain tissue from Harvard / Google, and the cubic millimeter mouse cortex dataset from our colleagues at the MICrONS consortium.

Recent advances have expanded the applicability of language models (LM) to downstream tasks. On one hand, existing language models that are properly prompted, via chain-of-thought, demonstrate emergent capabilities that carry out self-conditioned reasoning traces to derive answers from questions, excelling at various arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, with chain-of-thought prompting, a model is not grounded in the external world and uses its own internal representations to generate reasoning traces, limiting its ability to reactively explore and reason or update its knowledge. On the other hand, recent work uses pre-trained language models for plannin…]]></summary>

Imagine seeing this beauty as a bird does, flying past richly detailed, three-dimensional landscapes. Can computers learn to synthesize this kind of visual experience? Such a capability would allow for new kinds of content for games and virtual reality experiences: for instance, relaxing within an immersive flythrough of an infinite nature scene. But existing methods that synthesize new views from images tend to allow for only limited camera motion. 
  
In a research effort we call Infinite Nature, we show that computers can learn to generate such rich 3D experiences simply by viewing nature videos and phot…]]></summary>

This blog post was inspired by a previous Kubernetes blog post about
Advanced Server Side Apply.
The author of said blog post listed multiple benefits for applications and
controllers when switching to server-side apply (from now on abbreviated with
SSA). Especially the chapter about
CI/CD systems
motivated me to respond and write down my thoughts and experiences.
These thoughts and experiences are the results of me working on Kluctl
for the past 2 years. I describe Kluctl as "The missing glue to put together
large Kubernetes deployments, composed of multiple smaller parts
(Helm/Kustomize/...) in a manageable and unified way."
To get a basic understanding of Kluctl, I suggest to visit the kluctl.io
website and read through the documentation and tutorials, for exampl…]]></summary>

Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on training intelligent agents using related experiences so they can learn to solve decision making tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons, and designing hardware chips. Due to the generality of RL, the prevalent trend in RL research is to develop agents that can efficiently learn tabula rasa, that is, from scratch without using previously learned knowledge about the problem. However, in practice, tabula rasa RL systems are typically the exception rather than the norm for solving large-scale RL problems. Large-scale RL systems, such as OpenAI Five, which achieves human-le…]]></summary>

A common approach used to control robots is to program them with code to detect objects, sequencing commands to move actuators, and feedback loops to specify how the robot should perform a task. While these programs can be expressive, re-programming policies for each new task can be time consuming, and requires domain expertise.

What if when given instructions from people, robots could autonomously write their own code to interact with the world? It turns out that the latest generation of language models, such as PaLM, are capable of complex reasoning and have also been trained on millions of lines of code. Given natural language instructions, current language models are highly proficien…]]></summary>
