I also spent much of last week with my buddy Matt Raible and we made JHipster work with Spring Native, and I’m still giddy as can be about the newly opened possibilities. (More on that below) 

How are you doin’, otherwise? I hope you’re doing well! 

Now then, we’ve got a lot to cover and oh-so little time in which to do it. Let’s goo!

HyperLogLog++ for cardinality aggregations
C3 algorithm for adaptive replica selection
Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) for nearest vector search in Lucene

Malicious behavior protection applies behavior analytics to prevent attack techniques often leveraged by named threats by performing dynamic, stateful correlation of on-host events, and then reacting instantly to disrupt attacks before they cause damage.
Memory threat protection now safeguards Windows hosts, stopping attacks designed to evade most other defenses.
To accelerate response and prevent damage and loss, 7.15 adds host isolation for cloud-native Linux systems, making the capability now available on every OS protected by Elastic Agent.
