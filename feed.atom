Additionally, there’s no need to move data to a third-party framework for model training. 

Preconfigured machine learning models for observability and security are available. If those don't work well enough on your data, in-tool wizards guide you through the few steps needed to configure custom anomaly detection and train your model with supervised learning.

The rapid software development process that exists today requires an expanding and complex infrastructure and application components, and the job of operations and development teams is ever growing and multifaceted. Observability, which helps manage and analyze telemetry data, is the key to ensuring the performance and reliability of your applications and infrastructure. In particular, logs are the main default signal developers enable, providing a significant amount of detail for debugging, performance analysis, security, and compliance management. So how do you define a strategy to get the most out of your logs?

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced a new, alpha-level feature for
StatefulSets that controls
the ordinal numbering of Pod replicas. As of Kubernetes v1.27, this feature is
now beta. Ordinals can start from arbitrary
non-negative numbers. This blog post will discuss how this feature can be
used.
Background
StatefulSets ordinals provide sequential identities for pod replicas. When using
OrderedReady Pod management
Pods are created from ordinal index 0 up to N-1.
With Kubernetes today, orchestrating a StatefulSet migration across clusters is
challenging. Backup and restore solutions exist, but these require the
application to be scaled down to zero replicas prior to migration. In today's
fully connected world, even planned application downtime may not allow you to

The combination of the environment an individual experiences and their genetic predispositions determines the majority of their risk for various diseases. Large national efforts, such as the UK Biobank, have created large, public resources to better understand the links between environment, genetics, and disease. This has the potential to help individuals better understand how to stay healthy, clinicians to treat illnesses, and scientists to develop new medicines.


One challenge in this process is how we make sense of the vast amount of clinical measurements — the UK Biobank has many petabytes of imaging, metabolic tests, and medical records spanning 500,000 individuals. To best use this data, we nee…]]></summary>

Despite recent progress in the field of medical artificial intelligence (AI), most existing models are narrow, single-task systems that require large quantities of labeled data to train. Moreover, these models cannot be easily reused in new clinical contexts as they often require the collection, de-identification and annotation of site-specific data for every new deployment environment, which is both laborious and expensive. This problem of data-efficient generalization (a model’s ability to generalize to new settings using minimal new data) continues to be a key translational challenge for medical machine learning (ML) models and has in turn, prevented their broad uptak…]]></summary>

Engines in Elastic App Search enable you to index documents and provide out-of-the-box, tunable search capabilities. By default, engines support a predefined list of languages. If your language is not on that list, this blog explains how you can add support for additional languages. We’ll do this by creating an App Search engine that has analyzers set up for that language.
Before we dive into the details, let’s define what an Elasticsearch analyzer is:
An Elasticsearch analyzer is a package that contains three lower-level building blocks: character filters, tokenizers, and token filters. Analyzers can be built-in or custom. Built-in analyzers pre-package building blocks into analyzers suitable for different languages and types of text.
Analyzers for each field are used to:

Every byte and every operation matters when trying to build a faster model, especially if the model is to run on-device. Neural architecture search (NAS) algorithms design sophisticated model architectures by searching through a larger model-space than what is possible manually. Different NAS algorithms, such as MNasNet and TuNAS, have been proposed and have discovered several efficient model architectures, including MobileNetV3, EfficientNet. 

 


Here we present LayerNAS, an approach that reformulates the multi-objective NAS problem within the framework of combinatorial optimization to greatly reduce the complexity, which results in an order of magnitude reduction in the number of model candidates that must be …]]></summary>

This is the fourth blog post in our chess series (don’t forget to check out the first, second, and third posts!). Chess is a fascinating game. What can happen on those 64 squares? 

Lichess is a platform that allows you to play chess; it publishes all rated games as archives, starting in 2013. There are a total of over 4 billion games played. Yes, 4 billion matches.

In the third blog, we analyzed the impact of chess YouTubers and streamers such as GothamChess and Hikaru Nakamura and showed how to calculate the significance. What about our machine learning capabilities? Would our machine learning models, especially anomaly detection, detect the increase as an anomaly?

Feedback from end-users
SIG Security received some feedback from end-users:
The JSON CVE Feed did not comply
with the JSON Feed specification as its name would suggest.
The feed could also support RSS

For state and tribal governments thinking about applying for — or that have already applied for — funding from the US federal State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP) or Tribal Cybersecurity Grant Program (TCGP), you likely already know that building out a comprehensive cybersecurity plan is a required element in the process. If you’ve already submitted your application for fiscal year 2022 funding, you have until the end of September 2023 to submit your cybersecurity plan. (The exception here is if you already have a state-wide cybersecurity plan and will use the funding to implement or revise it.) 

States will also be able to apply for additional funding that will be released in the coming fiscal years. In that case, assembling the elements of your cybersecurity plan should also be on your radar.]]></summary>

Elastic Stack provides many valuable insights for different users. Developers are interested in low-level metrics and debugging information. SREs are interested in seeing everything at once and identifying where the root cause is. Managers want reports that tell them how good service performance is and if the service level agreement (SLA) is met. In this post, we’ll focus on the service perspective and provide an overview of calculating an SLA.
Foundations of calculating an SLA
There are many ways to calculate and measure an SLA. The most important part is the definition of the SLA, and as a consultant, I’ve seen many different ways. Some examples include:

Count of HTTP 2xx must be above 98% of all HTTP status
Response time of successful HTTP 2xx requests must be below x milliseconds

Before Kubernetes v1.8 (!), typos, mis-indentations or minor errors in
YAMLs could have catastrophic consequences (e.g. a typo like
forgetting the trailing s in replica: 1000 could cause an outage,
because the value would be ignored and missing, forcing a reset of
replicas back to 1). This was solved back then by fetching the OpenAPI
v2 in kubectl and using it to verify that fields were correct and
present before applying. Unfortunately, at that time, Custom Resource
Definitions didn’t exist, and the code was written under that
assumption. When CRDs were later introduced, the lack of flexibility
in the validation code forced some hard decisions in the way CRDs
exposed their schema, leaving us in a cycle of bad validation causing

Kubernetes 1.27 introduced a new feature called Node log query that allows
viewing logs of services running on the node.
What problem does it solve?
Cluster administrators face issues when debugging malfunctioning services
running on the node. They usually have to SSH or RDP into the node to view the
logs of the service to debug the issue. The Node log query feature helps with
this scenario by allowing the cluster administrator to view the logs using
kubectl. This is especially useful with Windows nodes where you run into the
issue of the node going to the ready state but containers not coming up due to
CNI misconfigurations and other issues that are not easily identifiable by
looking at the Pod status.
How does it work?

Time-series forecasting is an important research area that is critical to several scientific and industrial applications, like retail supply chain optimization, energy and traffic prediction, and weather forecasting. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that improving demand forecasting accuracy can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. 
 

Modern time-series applications can involve forecasting hundreds of thousands of correlated time-series (e.g., demands of different products for a retailer) over long horizons (e.g., a quarter or year away at daily granularity). As such, time-series forecasting models need to satisfy the following key criterias:

With the release of Kubernetes v1.27 the ReadWriteOncePod feature has graduated
to beta. In this blog post, we'll take a closer look at this feature, what it
does, and how it has evolved in the beta release.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is a new access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

Over the last few years, we have open-sourced libraries for privacy-preserving analytics and ML and have been constantly enhancing their capabilities.

The problem
On Linux with Security-Enhanced Linux (SELinux) enabled, it's traditionally
the container runtime that applies SELinux labels to a Pod and all its volumes.
Kubernetes only passes the SELinux label from a Pod's securityContext fields
to the container runtime.
The container runtime then recursively changes SELinux label on all files that
are visible to the Pod's containers. This can be time-consuming if there are
many files on the volume, especially when the volume is on a remote filesystem.
Note
subPath of a volume, only that subPath of the whole
volume is relabeled. This allows two pods that have two different SELinux labels
to use the same volume, as long as they use different subpaths of it.

If a Pod does not have any SELinux label assigned in …]]></summary>

and, as a result, we're actively working on improving the Topology Spread feature via three KEPs.
All of these features have reached beta in Kubernetes v1.27 and are enabled by default.
This blog post introduces each feature and the use case behind each of them.
KEP-3022: min domains in Pod Topology Spread
Pod Topology Spread has the maxSkew parameter to define the degree to which Pods may be unevenly distributed.
But, there wasn't a way to control the number of domains over which we should spread.
Some users want to force spreading Pods over a minimum number of …]]></summary>

Derivatives play a central role in optimization and machine learning. By locally approximating a training loss, derivatives guide an optimizer toward lower values of the loss. Automatic differentiation frameworks such as TensorFlow, PyTorch, and JAX are an essential part of modern machine learning, making it feasible to use gradient-based optimizers to train very complex models.


 


But are derivatives all we need? By themselves, derivatives only tell us how a function behaves on an infinitesimal scale. To use derivatives effectively, we often need to know more than that. For example, to choose a learning rate for gradient descent, we need to know something about how the loss function behaves over a small but finite windo…]]></summary>

Reinforcement learning (RL) can enable robots to learn complex behaviors through trial-and-error interaction, getting better and better over time. Several of our prior works explored how RL can enable intricate robotic skills, such as robotic grasping, multi-task learning, and even playing table tennis. Although robotic RL has come a long way, we still don't see RL-enabled robots in everyday settings. The real world is complex, diverse, and changes over time, presenting a major challenge for robotic systems. However, we believe that RL should offer us an excellent tool for tackling precisely these challenges: by continually practicing, getting better, and l…]]></summary>

Building models that solve a diverse set of tasks has become a dominant paradigm in the domains of vision and language. In natural language processing, large pre-trained models, such as PaLM, GPT-3 and Gopher, have demonstrated remarkable zero-shot learning of new language tasks. Similarly, in computer vision, models like CLIP and Flamingo have shown robust performance on zero-shot classification and object recognition. A natural next step is to use such tools to construct agents that can complete different decision-making tasks across many environments.

Aging is a process that is characterized by physiological and molecular changes that increase an individual's risk of developing diseases and eventually dying. Being able to measure and estimate the biological signatures of aging can help researchers identify preventive measures to reduce disease risk and impact. Researchers have developed “aging clocks” based on markers such as blood proteins or DNA methylation to measure individuals’ biological age, which is distinct from one’s chronological age. These aging clocks help predict the risk of age-related diseases. But because protein and methylation markers require a blood draw, non-invasive ways to find similar measures could make aging i…]]></summary>

Bayesian optimization (BayesOpt) is a powerful tool widely used for global optimization tasks, such as hyperparameter tuning, protein engineering, synthetic chemistry, robot learning, and even baking cookies. BayesOpt is a great strategy for these problems because they all involve optimizing black-box functions that are expensive to evaluate. A black-box function’s underlying mapping from inputs (configurations of the thing we want to optimize) to outputs (a measure of performance) is unknown. However, we can attempt to understand its internal workings by evaluating the function for different combinations of inputs. Because each evaluation can be computationally expensive, we need to find the best i…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In a recent post, we showed you how to get started with the free and open tier of Elastic Observability. Below, we'll walk through what you need to do to expand your deployment so you can start gathering metrics from application performance monitoring (APM) or "tracing" data in your observability cluster, for free.
What is APM?
Application performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.

In addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:

The problem
Since v1.19 (released in 2020), the Kubernetes project provides 12-14 months of patch releases for each minor version.
This enables users to qualify and adopt Kubernetes versions in an annual upgrade cycle and receive security fixes for a year.
The Go project releases new minor versions twice a year,
and provides security fixes for the last two minor versions, resulting in about a year of support for each Go version.
Even though each new Kubernetes minor version is built with a supported Go version when it is first released,
that Go version falls out of support before the Kubernetes minor version does,
and the lengthened Kubernetes patch support since v1.19 only widened that gap.
At the time this was written, just over half of all Go patch releas…]]></summary>
