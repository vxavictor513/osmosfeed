As the daughter of Italian immigrants to multicultural Australia, Anna Mascarello innately knows the importance of perceiving and adapting to cultural differences, whether that’s in a meeting with foreigners or traveling to countries with her husband and two kids.
“I've never thought about intercultural communication as a concept before. For me, it’s just a way that I’ve grown up. I’ve worked with some pretty amazing people and I think it's so important to understand the person as a whole and their background in order to appreciate different perspectives.”

This blog post was inspired by a previous Kubernetes blog post about
Advanced Server Side Apply.
The author of said blog post listed multiple benefits for applications and
controllers when switching to server-side apply (from now on abbreviated with
SSA). Especially the chapter about
CI/CD systems
motivated me to respond and write down my thoughts and experiences.
These thoughts and experiences are the results of me working on Kluctl
for the past 2 years. I describe Kluctl as "The missing glue to put together
large Kubernetes deployments, composed of multiple smaller parts
(Helm/Kustomize/...) in a manageable and unified way."
To get a basic understanding of Kluctl, I suggest to visit the kluctl.io

Healthcare data makes up a third of the world’s data and is projected to grow, in the next few years, at a faster pace than traditional data-rich industries like financial services and manufacturing. The staggering data volumes in healthcare, in addition to its heterogeneity and fragmentation, represent substantial challenges to extracting insights for improving healthcare outcomes of individuals and communities.

At Elastic, many of our Elasticians love cycling and exploring new and unique patches of road. We also love data analysis and visualization. I started to plan my upcoming cycling trip on Komoot. Planning a one-week trip with six rides is tricky, as you are hovering over the map and trying to find unique routes. Who wants to ride the same road multiple times?

After I was done planning in Komoot, I thought to myself: is there a way to identify if I am riding this road once, twice, or even more often? I also wanted to plot it and look at the data a bit more dynamically.

This is our goal today. Let’s build a dashboard that shows this information.

According to Gartner, 85% of organizations will embrace a cloud-first approach by 2025 and will look to leverage cloud-native technologies wherever they can.

With the average organization deploying nearly 90 applications last year — and large organizations deploying more than 185 — employees end up jumping back and forth between apps roughly 1,200 times each day, according to a recent Harvard Business Review report.

I’m doing great. I’m in sunny Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, eating delicious food and hanging out with amazing people. Tomorrow, I’m off to Penang, Malaysia, for a little tourism before I get back to a more code-driven kinda fun: I’ll be doing a developer event looking at the latest-and-greatest from Spring Boot 3 here in Kuala Lumpur on the 11th of November - ten short days from now! - so please join me!

Also, I just joined Mastodon - a decentralized and open-source Twitter; I’m not leaving Twitter, of course, but I would love to make new friends and grow the community there: @starbuxman@mastodon.online! 

Anyway, my friends, housekeeping aside, we’ve got a ton of amazing things to talk about today so let’s dive right into it!

Kubernetes is becoming increasingly pervasive and a majority of these deployments will be in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Some of you may be on a single cloud while others will have the added burden of managing clusters on multiple Kubernetes cloud services. In addition to cloud provider complexity, you also have to manage hundreds of deployed services generating more and more observability and telemetry data.

These systems generate massive amounts of data that needs to be analyzed and stored for auditing, threat hunting, and compliance purposes.

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

Whether it's a professional honing their skills or a child learning to read, coaches and educators play a key role in assessing the learner's answer to a question in a given context and guiding them towards a goal. These interactions have unique characteristics that set them apart from other forms of dialogue, yet are not available when learners practice alone at home. In the field of natural language processing, this type of capability has not received much attention and is technologically challenging.

Open Images is a computer vision dataset covering ~9 million images with labels spanning thousands of object categories. Researchers around the world use Open Images to train and evaluate computer vision models. Since the initial release of Open Images in 2016, which included image-level labels covering 6k categories, we have provided multiple updates to enrich annotations and expand the potential use cases of the dataset. Through several releases, we have added image-level labels for over 20k categories on all images and bounding box annotations, visual relations, instance segmentations, and localized narratives (synchronized voice, mouse trace, and text caption) on a subset of 1.9M images.

Evolution strategy (ES) is a family of optimization techniques inspired by the ideas of natural selection: a population of candidate solutions are usually evolved over generations to better adapt to an optimization objective. ES has been applied to a variety of challenging decision making problems, such as legged locomotion, quadcopter control, and even power system control.

Understanding the aesthetic and technical quality of images is important for providing a better user visual experience. Image quality assessment (IQA) uses models to build a bridge between an image and a user's subjective perception of its quality. In the deep learning era, many IQA approaches, such as NIMA, have achieved success by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based IQA models are often constrained by the fixed-size input requirement in batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized or cropped to a fixed size shape. This preprocessing is problematic for IQA because images can have very different aspect ratios and resolutions…]]></summary>

What is RUM?
Elastic real user monitoring, or RUM, captures user interactions with the web browser and provides a detailed view of the “real user experience” of your web applications from a performance perspective. Elastic’s RUM Agent is a JavaScript Agent, which means it supports any JavaScript-based application. RUM can provide valuable insight into your applications.

in various situations use it. So I’d like to write down some of those reasons.
Obvious (and not-so-obvious) benefits of SSA
A list of improvements / niceties you get from switching from various things to
Server-side apply!
Versus client-side-apply (that is, plain kubectl apply):

The system gives you conflicts when you accidentally fight with another
actor over the value of a field!
When combined with --dry-run, there’s no chance of accidentally running a
client-side dry run instead of a server side dry run.
Versus hand-rolling patches:

The SSA patch format is extremely natural to write, with no weird syntax.

The task of determining the similarity between images is an open problem in computer vision and is crucial for evaluating the realism of machine-generated images. Though there are a number of straightforward methods of estimating image similarity (e.g., low-level metrics that measure pixel differences, such as FSIM and SSIM), in many cases, the measured similarity differences do not match the differences perceived by a person. However, more recent work has demonstrated that intermediate representations of neural network classifiers, such as AlexNet, VGG and SqueezeNet trained on ImageNet, exhibit perceptual similarity as an emergent property. That is, Euclidean distances between encoded rep…]]></summary>

Robot learning has been applied to a wide range of challenging real world tasks, including dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and grasping. It is less common to see robot learning applied to dynamic, high-acceleration tasks requiring tight-loop human-robot interactions, such as table tennis. There are two complementary properties of the table tennis task that make it interesting for robotic learning research. First, the task requires both speed and precision, which puts significant demands on a learning algorithm. At the same time, the problem is highly-structured (with a fixed, predictable environment) and naturally multi-agent (the robot can play with humans or another robot), makin…]]></summary>

Through this process, organizations collect and analyze data, and determine if a program is performing as expected within set boundaries. When combined with alerting, monitoring allows for detecting unexpected system behavior to mitigate exceptional situations as fast as possible. Furthermore, tracking the performance of a system enables organizations to improve those aspects that have the biggest impact with higher priority. One essential aspect of monitoring is the list of key metrics you want to observe. There are different categories of statistics that can be of interest here. To observe the defined metrics, there are plenty of application monitoring tools on the market today. They differ in many aspects...

Building models that understand and generate natural language well is one the grand goals of machine learning (ML) research and has a direct impact on building smart systems for everyday applications. Improving the quality of language models is a key target for researchers to make progress toward such a goal.   

Most common paradigms to build and train language models use either autoregressive decoder-only architectures (e.g., PaLM or GPT-3), where the model is trained to predict the next word for a given prefix phrase, or span corruption-based encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, ST-MoE), where the training objective is to recover the subset of words masked out of the input.
