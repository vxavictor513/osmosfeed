Announcing graduation to General Availability (GA) - Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment in Kubernetes v1.28!
Kubernetes SIG Storage team is thrilled to announce that the "Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment" feature,
introduced as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.25, has now graduated to GA and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.28 release.
This enhancement brings a significant improvement to how default
StorageClasses are assigned to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
With this feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and then a PVC to assign the class.
Instead, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned will now be retroactively updated to include the default StorageClass.
This enhancement ensures that PVCs no longer get stuck in an unbound state, and storage provisioning works seamlessly,
even when a default StorageClass is not defined at the time of PVC creation.
What changed?
The PersistentVolume (PV) controller has been modified to automatically assign a default StorageClass to any unbound
PersistentVolumeClaim with the storageClassName not set. Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim
admission validation mechanism within
the API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.
How to use it?
As this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.
Simply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.
For more details, read about
default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.
To provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)
or participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.]]></summary>

Modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance across a variety of applications, such as language, mathematical reasoning, and vision. However, these networks often use large architectures that require lots of computational resources. This can make it impractical to serve such models to users, especially in resource-constrained environments like wearables and smartphones. A widely used approach to mitigate the inference costs of pre-trained networks is to prune them by removing some of their weights, in a way that doesn’t significantly affect utility. In standard neural networks, each weight defines a connection between two neurons. So after weights are pruned, the input…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is now GA in Kubernetes v1.28.
It was introduced as
alpha
in Kubernetes v1.24, and promoted to
beta
in Kubernetes v1.26.
This feature allows stateful workloads to restart on a different node if the
original node is shutdown unexpectedly or ends up in a non-recoverable state
such as the hardware failure or unresponsive OS.
What is a Non-Graceful Node Shutdown
In a Kubernetes cluster, a node can be shutdown in a planned graceful way or
unexpectedly because of reasons such as power outage or something else external.
A node shutdown could lead to workload failure if the node is not drained
before the shutdown. A node shutdown can be either graceful or non-graceful.

On behalf of Kubernetes SIG Release, I am very excited to introduce the
Kubernetes community-owned software
repositories for Debian and RPM packages: pkgs.k8s.io! The new package
repositories are replacement for the Google-hosted package repositories
(apt.kubernetes.io and yum.kubernetes.io) that we've been using since
Kubernetes v1.5.
This blog post contains information about these new package repositories,
what does it mean to you as an end user, and how to migrate to the new
repositories.
What you need to know about the new package repositories?
This is an opt-in change; you're required to manually migrate from the
Google-hosted repository to the Kubernetes community-owned repositories.
See how to migrate later in this announcement for migration infor…]]></summary>

Reading has many benefits for young students, such as better linguistic and life skills, and reading for pleasure has been shown to correlate with academic success. Furthermore students have reported improved emotional wellbeing from reading, as well as better general knowledge and better understanding of other cultures. With the vast amount of reading material both online and off, finding age-appropriate, relevant and engaging content can be a challenging task, but helping students do so is a necessary step to engage them in reading. Effective recommendations that present students with relevant reading material helps keep students reading, and this is where machine learning (ML) c…]]></summary>

After Wes Mason was promoted to Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Lead during the pandemic, he noticed that many of his typical coping mechanisms started to crumble.
While he suspected he had some form of neurodivergence, he didn’t have a diagnosis. Now he has a confirmed ADHD diagnosis after ticking nine of the 10 boxes on the evaluation. 
Being an SRE lead doesn’t involve managerial tasks, Wes says. But, it does involve meetings and being available to people to give feedback and technical guidance.
“I struggled with the role because people were waiting on me and I was losing focus,” he says.

In 1991, a weather system formed off the east coast of the United States with a cold front that created a low pressure ridge to the east of Nova Scotia. At the same time, a high-pressure system extending out from the Appalachian Mountains forced the ridge first southeast and then to the west, where it encountered the remnants of Hurricane Grace, which it promptly absorbed and swelled in size as it did so. The resulting storm caused over $200 million of damage to the United States and was known as “The Perfect Storm,” later to be immortalized in a book of the same name. 

For public sector organizations trying to deliver cybersecurity, a similar pattern is emerging — but perhaps with less visible effects. Disparate elements are combining with rapid intensity and have the potential to unleash a ferocious assault on the world’s cyber defenses.
Security threats and citizen data,
Thirdly, given this proliferation of security threats and the need to protect citizen data, governments are likely to increase regulation and compliance requirements. This puts additional pressure on public sector teams to learn and implement these new requirements — it may also have the adverse effect of plugging holes today without thinking about future needs.]]></summary>

In previous blogs, we explored how Elastic Observability can help you monitor various AWS services and analyze them effectively:


Managing fundamental AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon VPC, and NAT gateway
Data can be ingested into Elastic observability using a serverless forwarder or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
Ingesting and analyzing AWS VPC Flow logs


One of the more heavily used AWS container services is Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). While there is a trend toward using Fargate to simplify the setup and management of ECS clusters, many users still prefer using Amazon ECS with EC2 instances. It may not be as straightforward or efficient as AWS Fargate, but it offers more control over the underlying infrastructure.

Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor

Stephanie Harris has always had an interest in computers, but her initial career path started out in a different direction. 

Now, she’s a Senior Software Engineer at Elastic. 

Since she was young, Stephanie says she’s always had the ability to take confusing concepts and make them “make sense,” a skill that helped her on her winding path which eventually led her to Elastic.

“I don’t mind struggling at something,” she says. “I was very, very bad at guitar at the beginning, and then one day I wasn’t bad anymore.”

The last few years have seen rapid progress in systems that can automatically process complex business documents and turn them into structured objects. A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows. However, the datasets used in academic literature fail to capture the challenges seen in real-world use cases. Consequently, academic b…]]></summary>

Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…]]></summary>

Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline. When providing care, clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities including medical images, clinical notes, lab tests, electronic health records, genomics, and more.  Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations. The inputs to these systems tend to be complex data such as images, and they typically provide structured outputs, whether in the form of discrete grades o…]]></summary>

This year at Summit, an attendee posed a question about how to work with setting facts and changing data in Ansible. Many times we’ve come across people using task after task to manipulate data, to turn items into lists, filter our options, trying to do heavy data manipulation and to turn data from one source into another. Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own. While many of these options will work, they aren’t very efficient or easy to implement. Ansible Playbooks were never meant for programming.]]></summary>

Deep learning has recently made tremendous progress in a wide range of problems and applications, but models often fail unpredictably when deployed in unseen domains or distributions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. 
 

Designing adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…]]></summary>

AI-related products and technologies are constructed and deployed in a societal context: that is, a dynamic and complex collection of social, cultural, historical, political and economic circumstances. Because societal contexts by nature are dynamic, complex, non-linear, contested, subjective, and highly qualitative, they are challenging to translate into the quantitative representations, methods, and practices that dominate standard machine learning (ML) approaches and responsible AI product development practices.

In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at
scale requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line
interface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operator’s
toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a
Kubernetes cluster.
SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes
CLI
experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of
kubectl, the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes.
In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team
member, talked with Katrina Verey, Tech
Lead & Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej
