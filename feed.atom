Multimodal video captioning systems utilize both the video frames and speech to generate natural language descriptions (captions) of videos. Such systems are stepping stones towards the longstanding goal of building multimodal conversational systems that effortlessly communicate with users while perceiving environments through multimodal input streams.  
 Unlike video understanding tasks (e.g., video classification and retrieval) where the key challenge lies in processing and understanding multimodal input videos, the task of multimodal video captioning includes the additional challenge of generating grounded captions. The most widely adopted approach for this task is to train an encoder-…]]></summary>

I’m so excited to be here, at long last, after so long away from one of my favorite countries. I’ll be doing two talks - my usual, Kubernetes Native Java, and a talk on building Kubernetes Controllers (a.k.a. “Operators”) using the official Kubernetes Java client, Spring Boot, and Spring Native with my amazing friend and teammate Tiffany Jernigan, who you may recall was on the podcast not too long ago. 

After Toronto, I’m off to beautiful Berlin, Germany, for the We Are Developers show. 

If you’re at either show, don’t hesitate to say hi!

Elastic has been delivering timely and detailed security threat research for years — we’ve published more than 40 research articles and tools. We want to make it easier to find and share security threat research that will lead to a more secure workplace and a more protected industry overall.

“We feel that the availability of topical and timely security threat research has been traditionally inaccessible,” said Devon Kerr, Director of Elastic Security Research. “Elastic Security Labs intends to change this disparity and put in every security practitioner's hands the needed information and tools to protect their organizations.”

There is an urgent call to action for organizations to think and implement cybersecurity processes and technologies more strategically. The study shed some positive light for telecom companies as compared to peer industries. But, the MTTx (detect, respond, mitigate) and threat dwell time are high enough to raise serious concerns about how well armed the industry is to protect such critical network infrastructure.

A system is said to be "observable" when it has three things: logs, metrics, and traces. While metrics and traces have predictable structures, logs (especially application logs) are usually unstructured data that need to be collected and parsed to be really useful. Therefore, getting your logs under control is arguably the hardest part of achieving Observability. 

In this article, we’ll dive into three effective strategies developers can use to manage logs with Elasticsearch.

In this first installment, GraphQL Java lead Andi Marek (@andimarek) and  I (@starbuxman) look at the basics of using the GraphQL Java engine that underpins Spring for GraphQL. 


In this second installment, Andi and I are joined by Spring for GraphQL lead Rossen Stoyanchev (@rstoya05) as we look at using the Spring for GraphQL component model by writing queries. 


I know it’s been more than a month since we last published a video, so I’m going to be releasing every episode of this series very quickly, over the next week or two. I’ve already recorded and mostly finished producing eight episodes. I’m working on producing a ninth, and that’ll be that! A complete introduction to all things Spring for GraphQL. These are of course part of the usual Spring Tips playlist on YouTube, but also part of the Learn Spring for GraphQL with Josh Long playlist. Follow that one to be notified of any new episodes!]]></summary>

At Elastic, we encourage people to come as they are. Not, come as you think you should, but come as you really are. It’s written into our Source Code, the values that define our entire culture. 

And that culture is what made it easy for Corey Williams, Workplace Experience Lead, to seamlessly transition to Elastic. She joined the company as part of an acquisition, but with the cultural alignment of both companies, it was an easy move, says Williams.

“Culturally, I was able to just fit in,” Williams said. “The Source Code paralleled my previous company’s culture.”

Identifying as LGBTQ+ wasn’t a factor for Williams either. “I was able to just jump in and be who I am,” she says. “It’s remarkable how unremarkable it is.” For example, Williams is open with her team about her relationship a…]]></summary>

We’re excited to share an end-to-end demo that showcases how Elastic empowers developers to build rich search solutions. The demo provides mechanisms to run in your own environment, to ingest data into Elastic Enterprise Search using the Enterprise Search Python Libraries, and to create a modern UI in React, using the free and open source tool Search UI. 

Whether you are new to Elastic and need an example of putting together an interesting search application, or you have familiarity with Elastic and are looking for examples to show the whole experience, this sample can be used as a starting point for building a search experience of your own.

tldr; Go check out the GitHub repository and follow the steps to see the power of Elastic Enterprise Search in action!

TLDR; Today we will dive into the two available Terraform providers from Elastic. Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as a code and keep that in repositories to easily make changes.
Getting Started
Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) means managing your IT infrastructure via files so that changes can be applied automatically without intervention and are properly documented all the time. Terraform has become kind of a standard with some competitors like CloudFormation or Pulumi. Today we will focus on Terraform in combination with Elastic Cloud, so you do not need to use the Cloud UI to spin up, change or remove clusters.
Creating a Cloud API Key
In order to use Terraform, you need a cloud API key. Make sure this is not an API key for a Elastic Cloud instance but for your Elastic …]]></summary>

Mental health matters. And in a time where 1 in 5 adults experience some form of mental illness, it’s more important than ever to talk about. As we start to destigmatize mental health struggles and become more open about seeking help, it’s important to remember that adults aren’t the only ones impacted.

“Mental health challenges in children, adolescents, and young adults are real and they are widespread,” said US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in a public statement. “Even before the pandemic, an alarming number of young people struggled with feelings of helplessness, depression and thoughts of suicide – and rates have increased over the past decade.”

So what do you do if you’re a parent grappling with mental health issues in your family?

If you could update your security information and event management (SIEM) solution, what would you change? SIEMs have been around a long time and have been core to security operations. You wouldn’t be alone in wanting to make some upgrades. According to new research, 44% of respondents — including 51% of CEOs and 52% of CTOs surveyed — are looking to replace or augment their SIEM. 

“Cybersecurity Solutions for a Riskier World,” led by ThoughtLab and co-sponsored by Elastic, surveyed 1,200 executives about their organizations’ cybersecurity postures. SIEM was their top planned technology investment over the next two years — but many are looking for something different. Here’s what’s driving the change.

Over the last several years, there has been an increased focus on developing differential privacy (DP) machine learning (ML) algorithms. DP has been the basis of several practical deployments in industry — and has even been employed by the U.S. Census — because it enables the understanding of system and algorithm privacy guarantees. The underlying assumption of DP is that changing a single user’s contribution to an algorithm should not significantly change its output distribution.

Oftentimes, machine learning (ML) model developers begin their design using a generic backbone model that is trained at scale and with capabilities transferable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In natural language processing, a number of popular backbone models, including BERT, T5, GPT-3 (sometimes also referred to as “foundation models”), are pre-trained on web-scale data and have demonstrated generic multi-tasking capabilities through zero-shot, few-shot or transfer learning. Compared with training over-specialized individual models, pre-training backbone models for a large number of downstream tasks can amortize the training costs, allowing one to overcome resource limitations when building large s…]]></summary>

We’ve just released Spring Boot 2.7 which means that, so far, we’ve been maintaining the 2.x line for just over 4 years.
In total we’ve published 95 distinct releases over that timeframe!



The entire Spring team, and many in our community of contributors, are now preparing for the next generation of Spring.
We are planning to release Spring Boot 3.0 in November 2022.
This next major revision will be based on Spring Framework 6.0 and will require Java 17 or above.
It will also be the first version of Spring Boot that makes use of Jakarta EE 9 APIs (jakarta.*)  instead of EE 8 (javax.*).

Yesterday, my partner, her mother, and I went to Formentera, Spain, a little island off of Ibiza, Spain. It was amazing. We’re now in Ibiza, Spain, which is a little island not far from Barcelona, Spain, on the mainland of Spain. It feels a bit like that Inception movie. We traveled by boat to Formentera for a little vacation inside of another little vacation (Ibiza) and inside of another little vacation (Barcelona). Tomorrow I’ll return to Barcelona for the Spring IO event. Yes, technically, this is work. But it’s an oh-so-much pleasure, too. I can’t wait!

The project began with the modest goal to replace the (now archived) minimal GraphQL Java Spring integration, but has since moved significantly beyond through community feedback and collaboration across Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data, and Spring Security. 

The following are highlights from the release:


  
Annotation-based programming model for data fetchers

  
Data binding from input arguments with validation

  
Field-level security through annotations on data @Controller methods

  
Server handlers and interception over HTTP, …]]></summary>

In recent years, natural language processing models have dramatically improved their ability to learn general-purpose representations, which has resulted in significant performance gains for a wide range of natural language generation and natural language understanding tasks. In large part, this has been accomplished through pre-training language models on extensive unlabeled text corpora.  
This pre-training formulation does not make assumptions about input signal modality, which can be language, vision, or audio, among others. Several recent papers have exploited this formulation to dramatically improve image generation results through pre-quantizing images into discrete integer …]]></summary>

When people converse with one another, context and references play a critical role in driving their conversation more efficiently. For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him. Or if someone mentions “python” in a sentence, one can use the context from the conversation to determine whether they are referring to a type of snake or a computer language. If a virtual assistant cannot robustly handle context and references, users would be required to adapt to the limitation of the technology by…]]></summary>

Economics, combinatorics, physics, and signal processing conspire to make it difficult to design, build, and operate high-quality, cost-effective wireless networks. The radio transceivers that communicate with our mobile phones, the equipment that supports them (such as power and wired networking), and the physical space they occupy are all expensive, so it’s important to be judicious in choosing sites for new transceivers. Even when the set of available sites is limited, there are exponentially many possible networks that can be built. For example, given only 50 sites, there are 250 (over a million billion) possibilities!

In recent years, scaling up the size of language models has been shown to be a reliable way to improve performance on a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Today’s language models at the scale of 100B or more parameters achieve strong performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation, even with little or no training examples. Even the largest language models, however, can still struggle with certain multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning. How might we enable language models to perform such reasoning tasks?

Machine translation (MT) technology has made significant advances in recent years, as deep learning has been integrated with natural language processing (NLP). Performance on research benchmarks like WMT have soared, and translation services have improved in quality and expanded to include new languages. Nevertheless, while existing translation services cover languages spoken by the majority of people world wide, they only include around 100 languages in total, just over 1% of those actively spoken globally. Moreover, the languages that are currently represented are overwhelmingly European, largely overlooking regions of high linguistic diversity, like Africa and the Americas.
