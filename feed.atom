Caching is a ubiquitous idea in computer science that significantly improves the performance of storage and retrieval systems by storing a subset of popular items closer to the client based on request patterns. An important algorithmic piece of cache management is the decision policy used for dynamically updating the set of items being stored, which has been extensively optimized over several decades, resulting in several efficient and robust heuristics. While applying machine learning to cache policies has shown promising results in recent years (e.g., LRB, LHD, storage applications), it remains a challenge to outperform robust heuristics in a way that can generalize reliably beyond benchmar…]]></summary>

The recent progress in generative AI unlocked the possibility of creating new content in several different domains, including text, vision and audio. These models often rely on the fact that raw data is first converted to a compressed format as a sequence of tokens. In the case of audio, neural audio codecs (e.g., SoundStream or EnCodec) can efficiently compress waveforms to a compact representation, which can be inverted to reconstruct an approximation of the original audio signal. Such a representation consists of a sequence of discrete audio tokens, capturing the local properties of sounds (e.g., phonemes) and their temporal structure (e.g., prosody). By re…]]></summary>

Serverless and AWS ECS Fargate
AWS Fargate is a serverless pay-as-you-go engine used for Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS) to run Docker containers without having to manage servers or clusters. The goal of Fargate is to containerize your application and specify the OS, CPU and memory, networking, and IAM policies needed for launch. Additionally, AWS Fargate can be used with Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) in a similar manner.

Although the provisioning of servers would be handled by a third party, the need to understand the health and performance of containers within your serverless environment becomes even more vital in identifying root causes and system interruptions. Serverless still requires observability. Elastic Observability can provide observability for not only AWS ECS wit…]]></summary>

Once upon a time, not so long ago, the world was a different place. The idea of a "smartphone" was still a novelty, and the mobile phone was primarily a tool for making calls and, perhaps, sending the occasional text message. Yes, we had "smart" phones, but they were simpler, mostly geared toward business users and mostly used for, well, phone stuff. Web browsing? It was there, but light, not something you'd do for hours.

In 2007, a giant wave crashed onto the shores of our everyday lives, and the world has never been the same since. This wave was the iPhone. Despite being initially met with a blend of excitement, skepticism, and even downright dismissal (remember BlackBerry's response?), the iPhone quickly became a societal game-changer.

How quickly can the MoD take operational advantage of these advancements?

Now is the time to unleash the power of data and transform how the MoD approaches cybersecurity to outpace adversaries, gain multi-domain operational efficiency, and of course, attain rapid decision-making superiority. 

We know cybersecurity is a data problem. We know operational observability is a data problem, and we know mission search is also a data problem. This brings me to the punch line: these are all data problems. And the most common form that these use cases tackle is unstructured data — that is, open source intelligence and troves of data in hard-to-reach places.

Imagine you’re shown two identical objects and then asked to close your eyes. When you open your eyes, you see the same two objects in the same position. How can you determine if they have been swapped back and forth? Intuition and the laws of quantum mechanics agree: If the objects are truly identical, there is no way to tell. 



While this sounds like common sense, it only applies to our familiar three-dimensional world. Researchers have predicted that for a special type of particle, called an anyon, that is restricted to move only in a two-dimensional (2D) plane, quantum mechanics allows for something quite different. Anyons are indistinguishable from one another and some, non-Abelian anyons, …]]></summary>

Personally identifiable information (PII) compliance is an ever-increasing challenge for any organization. Whether you’re in ecommerce, banking, healthcare, or other fields where data is sensitive, PII may inadvertently be captured and stored. Having structured logs enables quick identification, removal, and protection of sensitive data fields easily; but what about unstructured messages? Or perhaps call center transcriptions?
Elasticsearch, with its long experience in machine learning, provides various options to bring in custom models, such as large language models (LLMs), and provides its own models. These models will help implement PII redaction.

As telcos deploy 5G networks, power consumption has become a significant concern. These networks require a large number of base stations and powerful hardware components to offer higher data rates and improved capacity. As a result, telcos are exploring various solutions to reduce power consumption in 5G networks. Machine learning from Elasticsearch® is one such solution that can help telcos reduce power consumption in several ways.
Intelligent network planning
Machine learning can help telcos analyze data from existing 5G networks, such as user traffic patterns and base station performance, to optimize network planning. By predicting future traffic patterns and base station usage, telcos can build more efficient and power-friendly networks. This can help reduce capital expenditure on ne…]]></summary>

US state and local government agencies continue to contend with a dizzyingly complex IT environment, which includes data silos, tool sprawl, rising cyber threats, and limited availability of cybersecurity experts. In response, many state CISOs are exploring a “whole-of-state” cybersecurity strategy, which aims to bolster their state’s security through centralization and collaboration.  
According to a Deloitte/NASCIO study, 42% of states have instituted legislation or funding for a state-wide cybersecurity program or framework — evidence that a whole-of-state approach is putting down some solid roots.]]></summary>

The proliferation of large diffusion models for image generation has led to a significant increase in model size and inference workloads. On-device ML inference in mobile environments requires meticulous performance optimization and consideration of trade-offs due to resource constraints. Running inference of large diffusion models (LDMs) on-device, driven by the need for cost efficiency and user privacy, presents even greater challenges due to the substantial memory requirements and computational demands of these models.

Organizations are becoming increasingly more reliant on data to make effective, evidence-based decisions to drive business outcomes. Whether this be assessing market conditions and improving customer experience, ensuring application uptime, or securing an organization, data from multiple sources — including consumers and internal systems — is critical to day-to-day operations. 

This data-driven approach requires organizations to collect, store, and analyze mountainous volumes of data at speed for timely decision making. Often this means performing correlation and analysis across multiple sources and formats of varying degrees of complexity at scale. 

Elasticsearch® provides the scalability and flexibility to ingest, store, and search these data sets to find relevant and actionable insi…]]></summary>

Last week, I wanted to find out the process for my fifteen year old daughter to get her first driver's license. Sounds simple enough. However, I ended up spending a good portion of my weekend searching for definitive answers — navigating multiple websites, without the option of asking a real, live person. In the very near future, I'll simply be able to ask a chatbot. The chatbot, using its natural language model trained on relevant government data, would provide a simple, step-by-step guide, explaining the entire process, required documents, and applicable fees. 

Using generative artificial intelligence (GAI), state and local governments have the potential to build applications that can interact with citizens in natural language, answering their questions accurately and instantly. Such …]]></summary>

People have the remarkable ability to take in a tremendous amount of information (estimated to be ~1010 bits/s entering the retina) and selectively attend to a few task-relevant and interesting regions for further processing (e.g., memory, comprehension, action). Modeling human attention (the result of which is often called a saliency model) has therefore been of interest across the fields of neuroscience, psychology, human-computer interaction (HCI) and computer vision. The ability to predict which regions are likely to attract attention has numerous important applications in areas like graphics, photography, image compression and processing, and the measurement of visual quali…]]></summary>

In the last few years, text-to-image generation research has seen an explosion of breakthroughs (notably, Imagen, Parti, DALL-E 2, etc.) that have naturally permeated into related topics. In particular, text-guided image editing (TGIE) is a practical task that involves editing generated and photographed visuals rather than completely redoing them. Quick, automated, and controllable editing is a convenient solution when recreating visuals would be time-consuming or infeasible (e.g., tweaking objects in vacation photos or perfecting fine-grained details on a cute pup generated from scratch). Further, TGIE represents a substantial opportunity to improve training of foundational models themselves. Multimodal mode…]]></summary>

Recent advances in video conferencing have significantly improved remote video communication through features like live captioning and noise cancellation. However, there are various situations where dynamic visual augmentation would be useful to better convey complex and nuanced information. For example, when discussing what to order at a Japanese restaurant, your friends could share visuals that would help you feel more confident about ordering the “Sukiyaki”. Or when talking about your recent family trip to San Francisco, you may want to show a photo from your personal album.

Automatic speech recognition (ASR) is a well-established technology that is widely adopted for various applications such as conference calls, streamed video transcription and voice commands. While the challenges for this technology are centered around noisy audio inputs, the visual stream in multimodal videos (e.g., TV, online edited videos) can provide strong cues for improving the robustness of ASR systems — this is called audiovisual ASR (AV-ASR).
 

Although lip motion can provide strong signals for speech recognition and is the most common area of focus for AV-ASR, the mouth is often not directly visible in videos in the wild (e.g., due to egocentric viewpoints, face coverings, and low resolution…]]></summary>

Large-scale models, such as T5, GPT-3, PaLM, Flamingo and PaLI, have demonstrated the ability to store substantial amounts of knowledge when scaled to tens of billions of parameters and trained on large text and image datasets. These models achieve state-of-the-art results on downstream tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering and open vocabulary recognition. Despite such achievements, these models require a massive volume of data for training and end up with a tremendous number of parameters (billions in many cases), resulting in significant computational requirements. Moreover, the data used to train these models can become outdated, requiring re-training…]]></summary>

Software isn’t created in one dramatic step. It improves bit by bit, one little step at a time — editing, running unit tests, fixing build errors, addressing code reviews, editing some more, appeasing linters, and fixing more errors — until finally it becomes good enough to merge into a code repository. Software engineering isn’t an isolated process, but a dialogue among human developers, code reviewers, bug reporters, software architects and tools, such as compilers, unit tests, linters and static analyzers.

Visual language is the form of communication that relies on pictorial symbols outside of text to convey information. It is ubiquitous in our digital life in the form of iconography, infographics, tables, plots, and charts, extending to the real world in street signs, comic books, food labels, etc. For that reason, having computers better understand this type of media can help with scientific communication and discovery, accessibility, and data transparency.

Creating robots that exhibit robust and dynamic locomotion capabilities, similar to animals or humans, has been a long-standing goal in the robotics community. In addition to completing tasks quickly and efficiently, agility allows legged robots to move through complex environments that are otherwise difficult to traverse. Researchers at Google have been pursuing agility for multiple years and across various form factors. Yet, while researchers have enabled robots to hike or jump over some obstacles, there is still no generally accepted benchmark that comprehensively measures robot agility or mobility. In contrast, benchmarks are driving forces behind the development of machine learning, such as ImageNet for computer…]]></summary>

Clustering is a central problem in unsupervised machine learning (ML) with many applications across domains in both industry and academic research more broadly. At its core, clustering consists of the following problem: given a set of data elements, the goal is to partition the data elements into groups such that similar objects are in the same group, while dissimilar objects are in different groups. This problem has been studied in math, computer science, operations research and statistics for more than 60 years in its myriad variants. Two common forms of clustering are metric clustering, in which the elements are points in a metric space, like in the k-means problem, and grap…]]></summary>
