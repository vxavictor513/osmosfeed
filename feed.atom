Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…]]></summary>

Today, we’re excited to announce the availability of the Logstash Operator for ECK in Technical Preview. Logstash® on Kubernetes integrates with the rest of the Elastic Stack on ECK and removes the need to manage all the resources individually and manually. 

The Logstash operator allows you to manage and configure Logstash pods in just a few lines of YAML with support for configuring Logstash pipelines using the familiar Logstash Domain Specific Language (DSL) inline in the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) or in mounted volumes. Multiple pipelines and pipeline->pipeline configurations are fully supported, and any updated pipelines will be detected and reloaded inside the pod, without requiring a restart of the pod.

Elastic recently contributed the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) to the OpenTelemetry (OTel) project, enabling a unified data specification for security and observability data within the OTel Semantic Conventions framework. We are committed to developing these open standards jointly. And today, we share that several more community-minded security technology vendors are contributing to this effort. Embracing the OTel Semantic Conventions framework helps users reduce the time and effort required for querying and correlating diverse data, building visualizations, and analyzing features for machine learning applications. Normalizing security and observability data with the OTel Semantic Conventions is a powerful tool that drastically reduces the complexity that so often hinders efficient analysis of software, performance, and security issues.

Security teams and technology vendors alike are embracing open data standards to enable holistic analysis of diverse data. In fact, OTel is the second-highest velocity project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) because of its vendor agnostic framework.

You may have read about our recent introduction of Elastic AI Assistant, but this isn’t just a new feature — it’s a key component  of a unified approach to security operations workflows that we call advanced entity analytics.

Advanced entity analytics combines Elastic’s highly operationalized machine learning capabilities for the detection of unusual behaviors, our entity-centric presentation of risk context to guide investigation and response, and our new generative AI sidekick. Together, these capabilities offer analysts the information they need to make fast and accurate decisions about potential threats encountered in their ecosystem.

With Elastic AI Assistant, we’ve scaled out of that trend to provide working capabilities now.

In this article, I'll explain how the setting ignore_malformed can make the difference between a 100% dropping rate and a 100% success rate, even with ignoring some malformed fields.

As a senior software engineer working at Elastic®, I have been on the first line of support for anything related to Beats or Elastic Agent running on Kubernetes and Cloud Native integrations like Nginx ingress controller.

During my experience, I have seen all sorts of issues. Users have very different requirements. But at some point during their experience, most of them encounter a very common problem with Elasticsearch®: index mapping exceptions.

As a leader in Security Analytics, we at Elastic are often asked for our recommendations for architectures for long-term data analysis. And more often than not, the concept of Limitless Data is a novel idea. Other security analytics vendors, struggling to support long-term data retention and analysis, are perpetuating a myth that organizations have no option but to deploy a slow and unwieldy data lake (or swamp) to store data for long periods of time.

Let’s bust this myth. In Elastic, limitless data isn’t a pipedream — it’s a reality. Thousands of our customers are already benefiting from a unified data layer that maintains months and years of actionable data in an affordable and rapidly accessible way.

Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline.

Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations.

Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own.

Deep learning has recently made tremendous progress in a wide range of problems and applications, but models often fail unpredictably when deployed in unseen domains or distributions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. 
 

Designing adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…]]></summary>

SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes

Learning from periodic data (signals that repeat, such as a heart beat or the daily temperature changes on Earth’s surface) is crucial for many real-world applications, from monitoring weather systems to detecting vital signs. For example, in the environmental remote sensing domain, periodic learning is often needed to enable nowcasting of environmental changes, such as precipitation patterns or land surface temperature. In the health domain, learning from video measurement has shown to extract (quasi-)periodic vital signs such as atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea episodes.

A key feature of human intelligence is that humans can learn to perform new tasks by reasoning using only a few examples. Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.

Computer Architecture research has a long history of developing simulators and tools to evaluate and shape the design of computer systems. For example, the SimpleScalar simulator was introduced in the late 1990s and allowed researchers to explore various microarchitectural ideas. Computer architecture simulators and tools, such as gem5, DRAMSys, and many more have played a significant role in advancing computer architecture research. Since then, these shared resources and infrastructure have benefited industry and academia and have enabled researchers to systematically build on each other's work, leading to significant advances in the field.
