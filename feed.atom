Lung cancer screening via computed tomography (CT), which provides a detailed 3D image of the lungs, has been shown to reduce mortality in high-risk populations by at least 20% by detecting potential signs of cancers earlier. In the US, screening involves annual scans, with some countries or cases recommending more or less frequent scans. 



The United States Preventive Services Task Force recently expanded lung cancer screening recommendations by roughly 80%, which is expected to increase screening access for women and ra…]]></summary>

Floods are the most common natural disaster, and are responsible for roughly $50 billion in annual financial damages worldwide. The rate of flood-related disasters has more than doubled since the year 2000 partly due to climate change. Nearly 1.5 billion people, making up 19% of the world’s population, are exposed to substantial risks from severe flood events. Upgrading early warning systems to make accurate and timely information accessible to these populations can save thousands of lives per year. 



Driven by the potential impact of reliable flood forecasting on people’s lives globally, we started our flood forecasting effort in 2017. Through this multi-year journey, we advanced…]]></summary>

Integration at the data layer
Having all organizational data available in a unified layer that provides the speed and scale of internet search solves many problems at once. Where before each application was designed to access only the data from its own repository, now all data is combined and accessible together within a single access point, a unified API, using a normalized query and ranking methodology.

Screen user interfaces (UIs) and infographics, such as charts, diagrams and tables, play important roles in human communication and human-machine interaction as they facilitate rich and interactive user experiences. UIs and infographics share similar design principles and visual language (e.g., icons and layouts), that offer an opportunity to build a single model that can understand, reason, and interact with these interfaces. However, because of their complexity and varied presentation formats, infographics and UIs present a unique modeling challenge.

Health datasets play a crucial role in research and medical education, but it can be challenging to create a dataset that represents the real world. For example, dermatology conditions are diverse in their appearance and severity and manifest differently across skin tones. Yet, existing dermatology image datasets often lack representation of everyday conditions (like rashes, allergies and infections) and skew towards lighter skin tones. Furthermore, race and ethnicity information is frequently missing, hindering our ability to assess disparities or create solutions.





To address these limitations, we are releasing the Skin Condition Image Network (SCIN) dataset in collaboration with physicians at Stanford Medicine. We designed…]]></summary>

A person's prior experience and understanding of the world generally enables them to easily infer what an object looks like in whole, even if only looking at a few 2D pictures of it. Yet the capacity for a computer to reconstruct the shape of an object in 3D given only a few images has remained a difficult algorithmic problem for years. This fundamental computer vision task has applications ranging from the creation of e-commerce 3D models to autonomous vehicle navigation. 



A key part of the problem is how to determine the exact positions from which images were taken, known as pose inference. If camera poses are known, a range of successful techniques — such as neural radiance f…]]></summary>

That would reduce the work to be performed by Elasticsearch. Let's see how to do that from an Elastic Agent with agent processors.

The Elastic Agent documentation says:

Elastic Agent processors are lightweight processing components that you can use to parse, filter, transform, and enrich data at the source. For example, you can use processors to:

Reduce the number of exported fields

Enhance events with additional metadata

Perform additional processing and decoding

Sanitize data

That's exactly what we want to do, but one of the limitations of the Elastic Agent processors is that it can not enrich events with data from Elasticsearch or othe…]]></summary>

In dermatology for example, skin cancer outcomes are worse for populations such as minorities, those with lower socioeconomic status, or individuals with limited healthcare access.

Large language model (LLM) advancements have led to a new paradigm that unifies various natural language processing (NLP) tasks within an instruction-following framework. This paradigm is exemplified by recent multi-task LLMs, such as T0, FLAN, and OPT-IML. First, multi-task data is gathered with each task following a task-specific template, where each labeled example is converted into an instruction (e.g., "Put the concepts together to form a sentence: ski, mountain, skier”) paired with a corresponding response (e.g., "Skier skis down the mountain"). These instruction-response pairs are used to train the LLM, resulting in a conditional generation model that takes an instruction as input and generates a response. Mo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I'm often seeing questions on discuss related to the Java API Client usage. For this, in 2019, I started a GitHub repository to provide some code examples that actually work and answer the questions asked by the community.
Since then, the High Level Rest Client (HLRC) has been deprecated and the new Java API Client has been released.
In order to keep answering questions, I needed recently to upgrade the repository to this new client. Although it uses the same Low Level Rest Client behind the scenes and an upgrade documentation has been provided, it's not really trivial to upgrade it.
I found interesting to share all the steps I had to perform to do this. If you are "just looking" for the pull requests that made the upgrade, have a look at:

Imagine all the things around you — your friends, tools in your kitchen, or even the parts of your bike. They are all connected in different ways. In computer science, the term graph is used to describe connections between objects. Graphs consist of nodes (the objects themselves) and edges (connections between two nodes, indicating a  relationship between them). Graphs are everywhere now. The internet itself is a giant graph of websites linked together. Even the knowledge search engines use is organized in a graph-like way.

People use tables every day to organize and interpret complex information in a structured, easily accessible format. Due to the ubiquity of such tables, reasoning over tabular data has long been a central topic in natural language processing (NLP). Researchers in this field have aimed to leverage language models to help users answer questions, verify statements, and analyze data based on tables. However, language models are trained over large amounts of plain text, so the inherently structured nature of tabular data can be difficult for language models to fully comprehend and utilize.

As these models increasingly enable assistive agents, it could be beneficial for them to learn effectively from each other, much like people do in social settings, which would allow LLM-based agents to improve each other’s performance. 

 


To discuss the learning processes of humans, Bandura and Walters described the concept of social learning in 1977, outlining different models of observational learning used by people. One common method of learning from others is through a verbal instruction (e.g., …]]></summary>

Seccomp stands for secure computing mode and has been a feature of the Linux
kernel since version 2.6.12. It can be used to sandbox the privileges of a
process, restricting the calls it is able to make from userspace into the
kernel. Kubernetes lets you automatically apply seccomp profiles loaded onto a
node to your Pods and containers.
But distributing those seccomp profiles is a major challenge in Kubernetes,
because the JSON files have to be available on all nodes where a workload can
possibly run. Projects like the Security Profiles
Operator solve that problem by
running as a daemon within the cluster, which makes me wonder which part of that
distribution could be done by the container
runtime.
Runtimes usually apply the profiles from a local path, for example:

Machine learning (ML) practitioners looking to reuse existing datasets to train an ML model often spend a lot of time understanding the data, making sense of its organization, or figuring out what subset to use as features. So much time, in fact, that progress in the field of ML is hampered by a fundamental obstacle: the wide variety of data representations. 





ML datasets cover a broad range of content types, from text and structured data to images, audio, and video. Even within datasets that cover the same types of content, every dataset has a unique ad hoc arrangement of files and data formats. This challenge reduces productivi…]]></summary>

One of the most popular ways developers use Kubernetes-related services is via cloud providers, but
have you ever wondered how cloud providers can do that? How does this whole process of integration

Cloud Provider.
SIG Cloud Provider works to create seamless integrations between Kubernetes and various cloud
