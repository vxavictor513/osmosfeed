        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[While developing Elasticsearch, we occasionally come across an important problem with no simple or established approach to solving it. It's natural to ask “hmm, is there an academic paper that addresses this?” Other times, academic work is a source of inspiration. We'll encounter a paper proposing a new algorithm or data structure and think “this would be so useful!” Here are just a few examples of how Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene incorporate academic work:

HyperLogLog++ for cardinality aggregations
C3 algorithm for adaptive replica selection
Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) for nearest vector search in Lucene
MIC statistic to improve machine learning classification
Block-max WAND for faster top-hits retrieval in Lucene
... and many more
