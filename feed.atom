Prompting large language models (LLMs) has become an efficient learning paradigm for adapting LLMs to a new task by conditioning on human-designed instructions. The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications. To address this problem, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of t‚Ä¶]]></summary>

Welcome to part two of Getting Started with the Elastic¬Æ Stack and Docker Compose. In the part one blog, we worked through the basics of Docker Compose and how to stand up a single-node cluster as your local playground, which includes Elasticsearch¬Æ, Kibana¬Æ, Logstash¬Æ, Metricbeat, and Filebeat. If you haven't read the first blog yet, you may want to hop over and read it before continuing.

In this blog, we‚Äôll be building on top of our previous cluster and implementing additional features such as Fleet, Agent, APM, and a demo application for your POC delight! Remember, Docker Compose is not recommended for production, even if the cluster sizing is larger.

Of course, if you‚Äôre already familiar and just want to code, feel free to TL;DR to the GitHub repo for the files.

If you‚Äôve paid attention to the quantum computing space, you‚Äôve heard the claim that in the future, quantum computers will solve certain problems exponentially more efficiently than classical computers can. They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.



For the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems.

What are the current options to migrate from OpenSearch to Elasticsearch¬Æ?
OpenSearch is a fork of Elasticsearch 7.10 that has diverged quite a bit from itself lately, resulting in a different set of features and also different performance, as this benchmark shows (hint: it‚Äôs currently much slower than Elasticsearch).
Given the differences between the two solutions, restoring a snapshot from OpenSearch is not possible, nor is reindex-from-remote, so our only option is then using something in between that will read from OpenSearch and write to Elasticsearch.
This blog will show you how easy it is to migrate from OpenSearch to Elasticsearch for better performance and less disk usage!

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo‚Ä¶]]></summary>

At Elastic¬Æ, we are constantly looking for new ways to simplify search experience, and we started to look at the IoT world. The collection of data coming from IoT can be quite challenging, especially when we have thousands of devices.

Elasticsearch¬Æ can be very useful to collect, explore, visualize, and discover data ‚Äî for all the data coming from multiple devices. Elastic‚Äôs distributed nature enables it to easily handle requests from millions of devices.

Thanks to the collaboration with Arduino, a very popular brand in IoT, we tested some devices and we developed an experimental open source library that connects Arduino boards to Elasticsearch in a very easy way.

In the dynamic realm of governmental regulations, the Digital Operational Resilience Act (DORA) in the EU emerges as a game-changer. Slated for a detailed rollout by early 2024, the buzz surrounding DORA has resonated within the information and communication technology (ICT) and financial sectors for quite some time, and its distinction lies in its holistic and authoritative approach.

DORA is heralded as the high-water mark for cybersecurity regulations tailored for the financial arena. Its mission? To redefine cybersecurity and supply risk management at a global scale, encompassing banks, insurers, pension providers, and the broader spectrum of ICTs aligned with European operations.

Typical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. 



Using methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons. Firs‚Ä¶]]></summary>

The 2023 Steering Committee Election is now complete. The Kubernetes Steering Committee consists of 7 seats, 4 of which were up for election in 2023. Incoming committee members serve a term of 2 years, and all members are elected by the Kubernetes Community.
This community body is significant since it oversees the governance of the entire Kubernetes project. With that great power comes great responsibility. You can learn more about the steering committee‚Äôs role in their charter.
Thank you to everyone who voted in the election; your participation helps support the community‚Äôs continued health and success.

A mobile phone‚Äôs camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone‚Äôs camera, without a Hollywood budget?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe‚Ä¶]]></summary>

kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes

The kubeadm tool now supports etcd learner mode, which
allows you to enhance the resilience and stability
of your Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the learner mode
feature introduced in etcd version 3.4.
This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption
in Kubernetes clusters:

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.

In recent years, we have witnessed rising interest across consumers and researchers in integrated augmented reality (AR) experiences using real-time face feature generation and editing functions in mobile applications, including short videos, virtual reality, and gaming. As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques. However, the majority of GAN models suffer from high computational complexity and the need for a large training dataset. In addition, it is also important to employ GAN models responsibly.
