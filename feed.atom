The constantly changing nature of the world around us poses a significant challenge for the development of AI models. Often, models are trained on longitudinal data with the hope that the training data used will accurately represent inputs the model may receive in the future. More generally, the default assumption that all training data are equally relevant often breaks in practice. For example, the figure below shows images from the CLEAR nonstationary learning benchmark, and it illustrates how visual features of objects evolve significantly over a 10 year span (a phenomenon we refer to as slow concept drift), posing a challenge for object categorization models.

Differential privacy (DP) is a property of randomized mechanisms that limit the influence of any individual user’s information while processing and analyzing data. DP offers a robust solution to address growing concerns about data protection, enabling technologies across industries and government applications (e.g., the US census) without compromising individual user identities.  As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations. Researchers have recently found errors in the mathematical proofs of private mechanisms, and their implementations. For example, researchers compared six sparse vector technique (SVT) variations and found that only two…]]></summary>

Then when you're ready to take your usage of Elastic to the next level of scalability and global availability, you can migrate your self-managed Elastic deployment to Elastic Cloud. 

This blog post presents a step-by-step guide to help you do that using a snapshot and restore process that leverages Google Cloud Storage as the reliable storage location for saving and accessing the snapshot files that are central to the migration process.

The process of migration involves taking a snapshot of the data in the self-managed Elastic stack, saving that snapshot to a Google Cloud Storage Bucket, and then restoring the snapshot to your Elastic Cloud deployment. Here’s a guided tour that includes every step required to accomplish this right from the web browser you're using to read this blog post.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The wisdom of the elephant parable
At the intersection of information technology and business leadership, the ancient parable of the blindfolded individuals and the elephant offers an insightful analogy. Originating from the Indian subcontinent, this story tells of six blindfolded individuals who encounter an elephant for the first time. Each individual touches a different part of the elephant — its side, tusk, trunk, knee, ear, and tail — and subsequently forms a distinct and limited understanding of what the elephant might be. The individual who feels the side believes the elephant to be a wall, the one who touches the tusk thinks it's a spear, and so forth. Subsequently, they argue fiercely, each convinced that their perception of the elephant is the whole truth.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[If you’re running your own self-managed Elastic® stack and are considering migrating to Elastic Cloud to take advantage of having Elastic manage your deployment so that it is always up-to-date with the latest features like the AI Assistant, this blog post is for you. 

This blog post provides a walkthrough of how to migrate a self-managed Elastic stack’s contents to Elastic Cloud using a snapshot and restore migration method. For the storage location of the snapshot, we’ll use Microsoft Azure Blob Storage, an ideal service for saving and accessing files with fine grain control provided by Azure Storage Accounts.

Objects and their relationships are ubiquitous in the world around us, and relationships can be as important to understanding an object as its own attributes viewed in isolation — take for example transportation networks, production networks, knowledge graphs, or social networks. Discrete mathematics and computer science have a long history of formalizing such networks as graphs, consisting of nodes connected by edges in various irregular ways. Yet most machine learning (ML) algorithms allow only for regular and uniform relations between input objects, such as a grid of pixels, a sequence of words, or no relation at all.

Thousands of new AI tools were launched, AI features were added to existing apps, and Hollywood screeched to a halt with concerns over the tech. There’s even an AI tool that evaluates how well you sing like Freddie Mercury, because of course there is!
But behind every AI tool or feature, there’s a large language model (LLM) doing all the heavy lifting, many of which are open-source. An LLM is a deep learning algorithm capable of consuming huge amounts of data to understand and generate language. They’re built on a neural network architecture, which allows them to be trained to perform a variety of natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as content generation, translation, categorization, and many other use cases. …]]></summary>

Time-series forecasting is ubiquitous in various domains, such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that improving demand forecasting accuracy can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the M5 competition).



At the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation, retrieval-augmented generation, and code completion. Thes…]]></summary>

Machine learning models in the real world are often trained on limited data that may contain unintended statistical biases. For example, in the CELEBA celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting “blond” as the hair color for most female faces — here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as medical diagnosis. 





Surprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to amplify such statistical biases, through the so-called simplicity bias of deep learning. T…]]></summary>

Text-to-image diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, and Imagen). While recent advancements in inference solutions on Android via MediaPipe and iOS via Core ML have been made in the past year, rapid (sub-second) text-to-image generation on mobile devices has remained out of reach.

AI-driven technologies are weaving themselves into the fabric of our daily routines, with the potential to enhance our access to knowledge and boost our overall productivity. The backbone of these applications lies in large language models (LLMs).  LLMs are memory-intensive and typically require specialized hardware accelerators to efficiently deliver tens of exaflops of computing power. This blog post shows how we can start addressing the computational challenges by utilizing memory more effectively.



The bulk of an LLM’s memory and compute are consumed by weights in matrix multiplication operations. Using narrower data types reduces memory consumption. For example, storing weights in the 8-bit integer (i.e., U8 or S8)…]]></summary>

Graphs, in which objects and their relations are represented as nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) between pairs of nodes, are ubiquitous in computing and machine learning (ML). For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. 




A common approach to learning on graphs are graph neural networks (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a message-passing framework,…]]></summary>

A common issue in running/operating Kubernetes clusters is running out of disk space.
When the node is provisioned, you should aim to have a good amount of storage space for your container images and running containers.
The container runtime usually writes to /var.
This can be located as a separate partition or on the root filesystem.
CRI-O, by default, writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containers, while containerd writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containerd.
In this blog post, we want to bring attention to ways that you can configure your container runtime to store its content separately from the default partition.
One area that needs more explaining is where/what Kubernetes is writing to disk.

In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact with machines, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation to unprecedented heights. Yet, the leap into high-stakes decision-making applications remains a chasm too wide, primarily due to the inherent uncertainty of model predictions. Traditional LLMs generate responses recursively, yet they lack an intrinsic mechanism to assign a confidence score to these responses. Although one can derive a confidence score by summing up the probabilities of individual tokens in the sequence, traditional approaches typically fall short in reliably dist…]]></summary>
