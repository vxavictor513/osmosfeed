TLDR; Today we will dive into the two available Terraform providers from Elastic. Terraform allows you to define your infrastructure as a code and keep that in repositories to easily make changes.

Infrastructure-as-code (IaC) means managing your IT infrastructure via files so that changes can be applied automatically without intervention and are properly documented all the time. Terraform has become kind of a standard with some competitors like CloudFormation or Pulumi. Today we will focus on Terraform in combination with Elastic Cloud, so you do not need to use the Cloud UI to spin up, change or remove clusters.
Creating a Cloud API Key
In order to use Terraform, you need a cloud API key. Make sure this is not an API key for a Elastic Cloud instance but for your Elastic …]]></summary>

Mental health matters. And in a time where 1 in 5 adults experience some form of mental illness, it’s more important than ever to talk about. As we start to destigmatize mental health struggles and become more open about seeking help, it’s important to remember that adults aren’t the only ones impacted.

“Mental health challenges in children, adolescents, and young adults are real and they are widespread,” said US Surgeon General Vivek Murthy in a public statement. “Even before the pandemic, an alarming number of young people struggled with feelings of helplessness, depression and thoughts of suicide – and rates have increased over the past decade.”

So what do you do if you’re a parent grappling with mental health issues in your family?

If you could update your security information and event management (SIEM) solution, what would you change? SIEMs have been around a long time and have been core to security operations. You wouldn’t be alone in wanting to make some upgrades. According to new research, 44% of respondents — including 51% of CEOs and 52% of CTOs surveyed — are looking to replace or augment their SIEM. 

“Cybersecurity Solutions for a Riskier World,” led by ThoughtLab and co-sponsored by Elastic, surveyed 1,200 executives about their organizations’ cybersecurity postures. SIEM was their top planned technology investment over the next two years — but many are looking for something different. Here’s what’s driving the change.

While the pace of digital transformation has accelerated, for many organizations the impact is just beginning. As enterprises connect even more processes and tools through cloud and platform technologies, digitized data will evolve into ever greater possibilities for action.

Over the past decade, 93% of companies have invested in digital transformation projects. As a result, 65% of global GDP will have been digitized in some way by the end of 2022, according to IDC. It is inevitable that this number grows, but what will define the next tech-driven transformation of the enterprise?

Over the last several years, there has been an increased focus on developing differential privacy (DP) machine learning (ML) algorithms. DP has been the basis of several practical deployments in industry — and has even been employed by the U.S. Census — because it enables the understanding of system and algorithm privacy guarantees. The underlying assumption of DP is that changing a single user’s contribution to an algorithm should not significantly change its output distribution. 
 In the standard supervised learning setting, a model is trained to make a prediction of the label for each input given a training set of example pairs {[input1,label1], …, [inputn, labeln]}. In the case of deep learning, previ…]]></summary>

Oftentimes, machine learning (ML) model developers begin their design using a generic backbone model that is trained at scale and with capabilities transferable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In natural language processing, a number of popular backbone models, including BERT, T5, GPT-3 (sometimes also referred to as “foundation models”), are pre-trained on web-scale data and have demonstrated generic multi-tasking capabilities through zero-shot, few-shot or transfer learning. Compared with training over-specialized individual models, pre-training backbone models for a large number of downstream tasks can amortize the training costs, allowing one to overcome resource limitations when building large s…]]></summary>

Azure Spring Cloud is now Azure Spring Apps

We launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019 to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we’ve helped many customers adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, FedEx, Kroger, Liantis, Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley’s, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more. Through customer feedback. we have expanded the capabilities of the service, including the Ent…]]></summary>

Yesterday, my partner, her mother, and I went to Formentera, Spain, a little island off of Ibiza, Spain. It was amazing. We’re now in Ibiza, Spain, which is a little island not far from Barcelona, Spain, on the mainland of Spain. It feels a bit like that Inception movie. We traveled by boat to Formentera for a little vacation inside of another little vacation (Ibiza) and inside of another little vacation (Barcelona). Tomorrow I’ll return to Barcelona for the Spring IO event. Yes, technically, this is work. But it’s an oh-so-much pleasure, too. I can’t wait! It’ll be the first time I’ve seen a ton of these people in years! I hope to see y’all there or los vemos!

On this page, you will find a how-to spin up ECK using Terraform. The main idea is to have a Kubernetes cluster and ECK installed by running only 3 commands.
Demo
To see the demo, please access https://github.com/framsouza/eck-terraform
Features
Every feature will be deployed via Terraform:

Install GKE (Google Kubernetes Engine) cluster
It will contain 1 node pool with 3 nodes (One in each zone) running on region europe-west1
It contains a helm provider that will be responsible to install the ECK operator
Elasticsearch cluster with 3 nodes
One Kibana instance

Requirements
Before starting you should have the following commands installed:

terraform
gcloud

Let's play
As you probably know, Terraform is an infrastructure as code tool, which means we can describe our infrastructure desire …]]></summary>

ThoughtLab’s newly released cybersecurity benchmark study revealed that cybersecurity is at a critical inflection point across industries. Although 60% of public sector organizations studied scored at the mid-implementation level according to the NIST maturity framework, mutually reinforcing megatrends such as digital transformation, remote work, platform economy, IoT, multi-clouds, institutionalized cybercrime, cyber warfare, and new regulations make the cybersecurity landscape more complex than ever before. 

It’s no surprise, then, that 34% of these organizations do not consider themselves well prepared for the rapidly changing threat landscape.

It’s been 10 months since the project was announced and under 2 years since the first commit, unremarkably called “first commit”. The project began with the modest goal to replace the (now archived) minimal GraphQL Java Spring integration, but has since moved significantly beyond through community feedback and collaboration across Spring Boot, Spring Framework, Spring Data, and Spring Security. 

The following are highlights from the release:

In recent years, natural language processing models have dramatically improved their ability to learn general-purpose representations, which has resulted in significant performance gains for a wide range of natural language generation and natural language understanding tasks. In large part, this has been accomplished through pre-training language models on extensive unlabeled text corpora.  
This pre-training formulation does not make assumptions about input signal modality, which can be language, vision, or audio, among others. Several recent papers have exploited this formulation to dramatically improve image generation results through pre-quantizing images into discrete integer …]]></summary>

When people converse with one another, context and references play a critical role in driving their conversation more efficiently. For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him. Or if someone mentions “python” in a sentence, one can use the context from the conversation to determine whether they are referring to a type of snake or a computer language. If a virtual assistant cannot robustly handle context and references, users would be required to adapt to the limitation of the technology by…]]></summary>

Economics, combinatorics, physics, and signal processing conspire to make it difficult to design, build, and operate high-quality, cost-effective wireless networks. The radio transceivers that communicate with our mobile phones, the equipment that supports them (such as power and wired networking), and the physical space they occupy are all expensive, so it’s important to be judicious in choosing sites for new transceivers. Even when the set of available sites is limited, there are exponentially many possible networks that can be built. For example, given only 50 sites, there are 250 (over a million billion) possibilities!

In recent years, scaling up the size of language models has been shown to be a reliable way to improve performance on a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Today’s language models at the scale of 100B or more parameters achieve strong performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation, even with little or no training examples. Even the largest language models, however, can still struggle with certain multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning. How might we enable language models to perform such reasoning tasks?

Machine translation (MT) technology has made significant advances in recent years, as deep learning has been integrated with natural language processing (NLP). Performance on research benchmarks like WMT have soared, and translation services have improved in quality and expanded to include new languages. Nevertheless, while existing translation services cover languages spoken by the majority of people world wide, they only include around 100 languages in total, just over 1% of those actively spoken globally. Moreover, the languages that are currently represented are overwhelmingly European, largely overlooking regions of high linguistic diversity, like Africa and the Americas.

The promise of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in solving complex, high-dimensional problems autonomously has attracted much interest in areas such as robotics, game playing, and self-driving cars. However, effectively training an RL policy requires exploring a large set of robot states and actions, including many that are not safe for the robot. This is a considerable risk, for example, when training a legged robot. Because such robots are inherently unstable, there is a high likelihood of the robot falling during learning, which could cause damage. 
The risk of damage can be mitigated to some extent by learning the control policy in computer simulation and then deploying it in the real world. However, this approac…]]></summary>

Graphs are very common representations of natural systems that have connected relational components, such as social networks, traffic infrastructure, molecules, and the internet. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning (ML) models for graphs that leverage their inherent connections to incorporate context into predictions about items within the graph or the graph as a whole. GNNs have been effectively used to discover new drugs, help mathematicians prove theorems, detect misinformation, and improve the accuracy of arrival time predictions in Google Maps. 
A surge of interest in GNNs during the last decade has produced thousands of GNN variants, with hundreds introduced each year. …]]></summary>

Over the last several years, the rapidly growing size of deep learning models has quickly exceeded the memory capacity of single accelerators. Earlier models like BERT (with a parameter size of < 1GB) can efficiently scale across accelerators by leveraging data parallelism in which model weights are duplicated across accelerators while only partitioning and distributing the training data. However, recent large models like GPT-3 (with a parameter size of 175GB) can only scale using model parallel training, …]]></summary>
