Let’s start with assurances that we’re not here to heap anxiety on anyone’s fear of missing out. That being said, we do want to make sure you’re aware of all the goodness that is available in Elastic Security, especially if you’re on an older version. It can be hard to find time to dig into every new release, to see what new features might be available, or check on ways to stretch your budget in order to pick up all the logs you might be missing.

Elastic® releases new versions fairly quickly, driven by new features, user submitted enhancement requests, and of course, the occasional bug fix. It can be challenging to schedule upgrades for every new release, particularly when we’re talking about a SIEM platform that needs to be running 24/7/365,…]]></summary>

Federal agencies are ramping up their use of artificial intelligence significantly, according to a US Government Accountability Office (GAO) audit. The report noted that there were 228 different AI use cases in operation, with over 500 more in planning and approximately another 500 in research or exploration phases. These numbers are likely conservative, considering the rapid advancement in AI since the report compiled its data for Fiscal Year 2022. 

Agencies are employing AI for diverse purposes to enhance their agency’s mission — from analyzing surveillance data for border activities to interpreting drone images to detecting cybersecurity threats and processing large data sets.

A recent wave of video generation models has burst onto the scene, in many cases showcasing stunning picturesque quality. One of the current bottlenecks in video generation is in the ability to produce coherent large motions. In many cases, even the current leading models either generate small motion or, when producing larger motions, exhibit noticeable artifacts.
 

To explore the application of language models in video generation, we introduce VideoPoet, a large language model (LLM) that is capable of a wide variety of video generation tasks, including text-to-video, image-to-video, video stylization, video inpainting and outpainting, and video-to-audio. One notable observation is that the leading video gene…]]></summary>

Fifteen minutes. That’s how long it took to empty the Colosseum, an engineering marvel that’s still standing as the largest amphitheater in the world. Two thousand years later, this design continues to work well to move enormous crowds out of sporting and entertainment venues.





But of course, exiting the arena is only the first step. Next, people must navigate the traffic that builds up in the surrounding streets. This is an age-old problem that remains unsolved to this day. In Rome, they addressed the issue by prohibiting private traffic on the street that passes directly by the Colosseum. This policy worked there, but what if you’re not in Rome? What if you’re at the Superbowl? Or at a Taylor Swift concert?

Recently, the US Government Accountability Office (GAO) released a study tracking US federal agencies’ progress on meeting the requirements set out in OMB M-21-31. Released in 2021, the Office of Management and Budget (OMB)’s M-21-31 memorandum provided guidance and requirements for federal agencies in order to improve centralized visibility into logging data before, during, and after cybersecurity incidents. The memo outlined a logging maturity model with four tiers (E0-3) to guide agencies in their compliance process.

In the new study, GAO found that agencies “have made progress in preparing for and responding to cyber threats.” At the same time, however, the study noted that 20 of the 23 agencies did not meet M-21-31’s tier 3 advanced event logging (“advanced EL3”) August deadline for tracking, storing, and managing event logs.

The study highlighted three challenges agencies are facing as they work to meet M-21-31 event logging requirements: 


Lack of staff

Event logging technical challenges

Limitations in cyber event information sharing


In this post, we’ll walk through these challenges and share how we’ve seen federal customers address them using Elasticsearch®.

On December 8, 2023, the European Union made a significant step in digital governance by introducing the first set of comprehensive artificial intelligence (AI) regulations. This legislation, poised for a European Parliament vote by early 2024, is first out of the gate in regulating AI. As organizations look to comply with this act (and the additional regulations likely to come on its heels), one thing is for sure: The ability to have access and insight into all data will be essential. And the stakes have never been higher.

In the absence of other observability signals, generally everything in your infrastructure (hardware, software, and services) emits log lines. Logs, however, are often structured at a developer’s whim and, first and foremost, serve the developer’s needs (e.g., debugging). Once in production, these same log lines are inherently promoted to a first-class means of observing your applications and infrastructure, regardless of their original intent. This makes logs a notoriously noisy observability signal whose rate can swing wildly with errors and scale.

The simplicity of the log line as an observability signal (fundamentally, it’s just text!) makes it deceivingly simple to observe. On the other hand, its noisy, unstructured nature and unpredictable rate make it among the most difficult of …]]></summary>

In Kubernetes 1.29, an improvement has been introduced to enhance the taint-based pod eviction handling on nodes.
This blog discusses the changes made to node-lifecycle-controller
to separate its responsibilities and improve overall code maintainability.
Summary of changes
node-lifecycle-controller previously combined two independent functions:
Adding a pre-defined set of NoExecute taints to Node based on Node's condition.
Performing pod eviction on NoExecute taint.

The kubelet manages the value for that condition throughout a Pod's lifecycle,

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Why choose a Managed Service Provider (MSP)? ,
Using an MSP allows you to focus on your core business instead of your IT infrastructure. The right MSP not only provides deep technical expertise and 24/7 monitoring and management of your infrastructure, but it can also improve core operational and procedural challenges over time to help you reduce costs and streamline operations, so your IT team can focus on projects that accelerate your business.
Ready to engage with an Elastic Verified MSP?,
Whether you want to leverage Elastic within your data center or via the cloud, here are eight areas to consider when selecting a MSP:

Support: Ensure that your preferred MSP offers 24/7 support and security operation center(s) across time zones.

Pricing: Review pricing models to make sure it fits within your resources.

Breadth of services: Consider your needs today, but also what you might need in one, three, or five years. Choose an MSP with a wide range of services so you’re able to grow together and build a lasting partnership. 

Cloud or hybrid posture: What is your current environment? Make sure your MSP supports your model.

Service offerings: Inquire about additional offerings, like consulting or migration services.

This blog introduces a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.29.
It provides a configurable approach to define how Service implementations,
exemplified in this blog by kube-proxy,
handle traffic from pods to the Service, within the cluster.
Background
In older Kubernetes releases, the kube-proxy would intercept traffic that was destined for the IP
address associated with a Service of type: LoadBalancer. This happened whatever mode you used
for kube-proxy.
The interception implemented the expected behavior (traffic eventually reaching the expected
endpoints behind the Service). The mechanism to make that work depended on the mode for kube-proxy;
on Linux, kube-proxy in iptables mode would redirecting packets directly to the endpoint; in ipvs mode,
kube-proxy would configure t…]]></summary>

With the release of Kubernetes v1.29, the ReadWriteOncePod volume access mode
has graduated to general availability: it's part of Kubernetes' stable API. In
this blog post, I'll take a closer look at this access mode and what it does.
What is ReadWriteOncePod?
ReadWriteOncePod is an access mode for
PersistentVolumes (PVs)
and PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs)
introduced in Kubernetes v1.22. This access mode enables you to restrict volume
access to a single pod in the cluster, ensuring that only one pod can write to
the volume at a time. This can be particularly useful for stateful workloads
that require single-writer access to storage.

With the recent and accelerated advances in machine learning (ML), machines can understand natural language, engage in conversations, draw images, create videos and more. Modern ML models are programmed and trained using ML programming frameworks, such as TensorFlow, JAX, PyTorch, among many others. These libraries provide high-level instructions to ML practitioners, such as linear algebra operations (e.g., matrix multiplication, convolution, etc.) and neural network layers (e.g., 2D convolution layers, transformer layers).

Text-to-image models trained on large volumes of image-text pairs have enabled the creation of rich and diverse images encompassing many genres and themes. Moreover, popular styles such as “anime” or “steampunk”, when added to the input text prompt, may translate to specific visual outputs. While many efforts have been put into prompt engineering, a wide range of styles are simply hard to describe in text form due to the nuances of color schemes, illumination, and other characteristics. As an example, “watercolor painting” may refer to various styles, and using a text prompt that simply says “watercolor painting style” may either result in one specific style or an unpredictable mix of several.

The v1.29 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to support modifying a volume

With the feature enabled, Kubernetes can handle updates of volume attributes other than capacity.
Allowing volume attributes to be changed without managing it through different

For Kubernetes v1.29, you need to use additional components to integrate your
Kubernetes cluster with a cloud infrastructure provider. By default, Kubernetes
v1.29 components abort if you try to specify integration with any cloud provider using
one of the legacy compiled-in cloud provider integrations. If you want to use a legacy
integration, you have to opt back in - and a future release will remove even that option.
In 2018, the Kubernetes community agreed to form the Cloud Provider Special
Interest Group (SIG), with a mission to externalize all cloud provider
integrations and remove all the existing in-tree cloud provider integrations.
