Interested readers can also check out the excellent Unknown Known DLLs ... and other Code Integrity Trust Violations for a deeper understanding of code integrity and protected processes.

While the full list of features, enhancements and bug fixes is available here, I’d like to call out few of them in this post and provide some details.
gRPC Support

In addition to an already existing support for invoking function via AWS Lambda, RSocket, Spring Cloud Stream etc., Spring Cloud Function now allows you to invoke function via gRPC.
Two ways to benefit from it. 
Spring Message

Given the wide adaption of Spring Messaging, one way of benefiting from gRPC support is by embracing Spring’s Message.
Spring Cloud Function provides GrpcSpringMessage schema modeled after Spring’s Message. It is internally converted to Spring Message to benefit from all of the existing support for Spring Messaging.

In recent years, pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, have seen widespread use in natural language processing (NLP). By training on large volumes of text, language models acquire broad knowledge about the world, achieving strong performance on various NLP benchmarks. These models, however, are often opaque in that it may not be clear why they perform so well, which limits further hypothesis-driven improvement of the models. Hence, a new line of scientific inquiry has arisen: what linguistic knowledge is contained in these models? 
 While there are many types of linguistic knowledge that one may want to investigate, a topic that provides a strong basis for analysis is the subject–verb ag…]]></summary>

Most reinforcement learning (RL) and sequential decision making algorithms require an agent to generate training data through large amounts of interactions with their environment to achieve optimal performance. This is highly inefficient, especially when generating those interactions is difficult, such as collecting data with a real robot or by interacting with a human expert. This issue can be mitigated by reusing external sources of knowledge, for example, the RL Unplugged Atari dataset, which includes data of a synthetic agent playing Atari games.  
 However, there are very few of these datasets and a variety of tasks and ways of generating data in sequential decision making …]]></summary>

For many concepts, there is no direct one-to-one translation from one language to another, and even when there is, such translations often carry different associations and connotations that are easily lost for a non-native speaker. In such cases, however, the meaning may be more obvious when grounded in visual examples. Take, for instance, the word "wedding". In English, one often associates a bride in a white dress and a groom in a tuxedo, but when translated into Hindi (शादी), a more appropriate association may be a bride wearing vibrant colors and a groom wearing a sherwani.

Here in the US, we just celebrated the Thanksgiving holiday, and I am fat with turkey and pie, and lazy. But happy. I hope you’re well fed and happy, too. Time’s flying. (Also: can you believe we’re a month away from the new year? I think there’s like four or five weeks (and thus _This Week in Spring_s!) left in the year!) 

We’ve got a ton of stuff to get into this week, so let’s go:


  
Security Report for Spring AMQP (Spring for RabbitMQ)

  
Spring Boot 2.6.1 is now available

  
Spring Data MongoDB - Relation Modelling

  
Thymeleaf 3.0.13 now available! This new version includes security improvements, make sure to check the release notes

  
In last week’s installmetn of A Bootiful Podcast, I talked about reactive-systems with functional programming legend Debasish Ghosh

  
The Apache Cassandra project is working hard to officially support JDK 17 in the next Apache Cassandra major release.

  
I love to see how far the JVM has come. One great indicator of its progress: its garbage collector. Check out this post on garbage collection progress from JDK 8 to JDK 17

  
This is so cool! There’s now an Oracle Database Kubernetes Operator

  
JEP 420: Pattern Matching for switch (Second Preview)

  
Java on Visual Studio Code Update – October 2021

  
For a lot of folks, the days of using Docker Desktop for free are numbered. You might be interested in this blog on Rancher Desktop - A Docker Desktop Replacement]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[MongoDB’s flexible schema allows for multiple patterns when it comes to modeling relationships between entities. Also, for many use cases, a denormalized data model (storing related data right within a single document) might be the best choice, because all information is kept in one place, so that the application requires fewer queries to fetch all data. However, this approach also has its downsides, such as potential data duplication, larger documents, and the maximum document size.



In general, MongoDB recommends using normalized data models when the advantages of embedding are neglected by the implications of duplication. In this blog post, we take a look at the different possibilities of linking documents with manual references and DBRefs when the need occurs to work with relation…]]></summary>

It is very common in Elasticsearch to request results to be sorted by a certain field. We have invested a great deal of time and effort to optimize sort queries to make them faster for our users. This blog will describe some of the sort optimizations for numeric and date fields.
How sorted queries work
When you want to find documents matching a filter and request results to be sorted by a certain field, Elasticsearch would examine this field’s doc values for all documents matched by the filter and choose the top K documents with the top values. In the worst case of a very broad filter (e.g. match_all query), we have to examine and compare doc values for all documents in an index. For big indices, this may take a substantial amount of time. 
One way to optimize sort queries on a particula…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I am excited to announce that Spring HATEOAS 1.4 GA has been part of the cascade of releases that lead to the Spring Boot 2.6 last week.
The release ships a couple of new features and all bug fixes we have incorporated in the 1.3.x line.
The most notable new features are:





Full support for level 4 URI templates



Support for non-composite request parameter rendering



Improved HAL-FORMS support (additional property constraints, custom media types)



Additional HTML input types (checkbox, radio, file)



General dependency upgrades, including Spring Framework 5.3.13 and Jackson 2.13.9.





Find more detailed information about all changes made in the 1.4 line in the release’s change log.
The release was included in the Spring Boot 2.6 release announced last week.
In other words, if you have upgraded to that, you’ve already successfully upgraded to Spring HATEOAS 1.4.



We have also released maintenance versions for the 1.3 and 1.2 lines.
Please note, that 1.2.11 is the last release of that branch and 1.2 is going out of OSS maintenance.
Find more about the support timelines for each branch in the newly introduced tab of our project homepage.



Also note, that due to a typo during the release procedure for 1.2.11, a 1.12.11 release has made it onto Maven Central.
The binaries are logically equivalent to 1.2.11, but their presence is likely to cause trouble with tools automating library upgrades.
We’re currently working with Sonatype to investigate options to potentially remove the invalid artifacts.]]></summary>

One of the nicest things about Byte Buddy is that it allows you to write a Java agent without manually having to deal with byte code. To instrument a method, agent authors can simply write the code they want to inject in pure Java. This makes writing Java agents much more accessible and avoids complicated on-boarding requirements.
After the first successful experiments, agent authors often get hit by a wall of complexity that the JVM throws at them: class loaders (OSGi, oh my!), class visibility, dependence on internal APIs, class path scanners, and version conflicts to name a few. 
In this article, we'll look at a relatively novel approach to break through this wall of complexity. The architecture, which is based on the invokedynamic bytecode instruction, a bytecode that is best known f…]]></summary>

Despite considerable progress in robot learning over the past several years, some policies for robotic agents can still struggle to decisively choose actions when trying to imitate precise or complex behaviors. Consider a task in which a robot tries to slide a block across a table to precisely position it into a slot. There are many possible ways to solve this task, each requiring precise movements and corrections. The robot must commit to just one of these options, but must also be capable of changing plans each time the block ends up sliding farther than expected. Although one might expect such a task to be easy, that is often not the case for modern learning-based robots, which often le…]]></summary>

Hi, Spring fans! It’s Friday, and you know what that means? Some poor schlub somewhere is trying fruitlessly to get something deployed to production, or at least rolled back consistently, in time for dinner. And it’s not working. I’ve been there. Deployments are hard. There’s nuance in deployment. I love Kubernetes as much as the next Operator, but let’s not pretend it’s the pinnacle of productivity. Quite the contrary. There’s a whole cottage industry around simplifying application deployments with Kubernetes. See for example KNative,  Cloud Foundry on Ku…]]></summary>

Illiteracy affects at least 773 million people globally, both young and old. For these individuals, reading information from unfamiliar sources or on unfamiliar topics can be extremely difficult. Unfortunately, these inequalities have been further magnified by the global pandemic as a result of unequal access to education in reading and writing. In fact, UNESCO reports that over 100 million children are falling behind the minimum proficiency level in reading due to COVID-related school closures.

 Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on learning from experiences to solve decision making tasks. While the field of RL has made great progress, resulting in impressive empirical results on complex tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons and designing hardware chips, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the current standards for empirical evaluation might give a false sense of fast scientific progress while slowing it down.

The application of deep learning models to weather forecasts can be relevant to people on a day-to-day basis, from helping people plan their day to managing food production, transportation systems, or the energy grid. Weather forecasts typically rely on traditional physics-based techniques powered by the world’s largest supercomputers.

Most wearable smart devices and mobile phones have the means to communicate with the user through tactile feedback, enabling applications from simple notifications to sensory substitution for accessibility. Typically, they accomplish this using vibrotactile actuators, which are small electric vibration motors. However, designing a haptic system that is well-targeted and effective for a given task requires experimentation with the number of actuators and their locations in the device, yet most practical applications require standalone on-body devices and integration into small form factors. This combination of factors can be difficult to address outside of a laboratory as integrating these systems can be quite time-consuming and…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Dave Epstein, Student Researcher and Chen Sun, Staff Research Scientist, Google Research   
Machine learning (ML) agents are increasingly deployed in the real world to make decisions and assist people in their daily lives. Making reasonable predictions about the future at varying timescales is one of the most important capabilities for such agents because it enables them to predict changes in the world around them, including other agents’ behaviors, and plan how to act next. Importantly, successful future prediction requires both capturing meaningful transitions in the environment (e.g., dough transforming into bread) and adapting to how transitions unfold over time in order to make decisions.

When building a deep model for a new machine learning application, researchers often begin with existing network architectures, such as ResNets or EfficientNets. If the initial model’s accuracy isn’t high enough, a larger model may be a tempting alternative, but may not actually be the best solution for the task at hand. Instead, better performance potentially could be achieved by designing a new model that is optimized for the task. However, such efforts can be challenging and usually require considerable resources.  
In “Wisdom of Committees: An Overlooked Approach to Faster and More Accurate Models”,  we discuss model ensembles and a subset called model cascades, both of which…]]></summary>

Earlier this year, we launched Contactless Sleep Sensing in Nest Hub, an opt-in feature that can help users better understand their sleep patterns and nighttime wellness. While some of the most critical sleep insights can be derived from a person’s overall schedule and duration of sleep, that alone does not tell the complete story. The human brain has special neurocircuitry to coordinate sleep cycles — transitions between deep, light, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of sleep — vital not only for physical and emotional wellbeing, but also for optimal physical and cognitive performance. Combining such sleep staging information with disturbance events can help you better understand what’s hap…]]></summary>
