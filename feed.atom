It’s noon as I write this, and I’ve got GSUG joint presentation with Matt Raible later today. Then, tonight at midnight my time to 5 am or 6 am, I’m kicking off a two-day workshop for GOTO! I look forward to seeing ya there! Anyway, we’ve got a lot to cover so let’s dive into it! 


  
Read this first! If you’ve been living under a rock, you may not have heard of the recent Log4J2 vulnerability. If you’re using the default, out-of-the-box Spring Boot logging support, then this does not apply to you! But, if you are using Log4j2, specifically, then you need to read this post on Log4j2 and Spring Boot!

Multi-horizon forecasting, i.e. predicting variables-of-interest at multiple future time steps, is a crucial challenge in time series machine learning. Most real-world datasets have a time component, and forecasting the future can unlock great value. For example, retailers can use future sales to optimize their supply chain and promotions, investment managers are interested in forecasting the future prices of financial assets to maximize their performance, and healthcare institutions can use the number of future patient admissions to have sufficient personnel and equipment.

Tokenization is a fundamental pre-processing step for most natural language processing (NLP) applications. It involves splitting text into smaller units called tokens (e.g., words or word segments) in order to turn an unstructured input string into a sequence of discrete elements that is suitable for a machine learning (ML) model. ln deep learning–based models (e.g., BERT), each token is mapped to an embedding vector to be fed into the model.

Large language models (e.g., GPT-3) have many significant capabilities, such as performing few-shot learning across a wide array of tasks, including reading comprehension and question answering with very few or no training examples. While these models can perform better by simply using more parameters, training and serving these large models can be very computationally intensive. Is it possible to train and use these models more efficiently? 
  
In pursuit of that question, today we introduce the Generalist Language Model (GLaM), a trillion weight model that can be trained and served efficiently (in terms of computation and energy use) thanks to sparsity, and achieves competitive performance on multiple f…]]></summary>

The payments industry has evolved dramatically over the past decade. Traditional payment vehicles still make up the majority of transaction flows, but new apps and startups continue to grow in popularity, and billions of dollars move through their systems.
According to a recent JPMorgan study, of the $240 trillion in global payments in 2020, ~$54 trillion can be attributed to emerging mega-themes; that is, trends that are reshaping the way money changes hands. These themes include super apps, e-commerce, digital wallets, wearables, BNPL (buy now, pay later), connected cars, and other payment vehicles.

Scaling neural networks, whether it be the amount of training data used, the model size or the computation being utilized,  has been critical for improving model quality in many real-world machine learning applications, such as computer vision, language understanding and neural machine translation. This, in turn, has motivated recent studies to scrutinize the factors that play a critical role in the success of scaling a neural model. Although increasing model capacity can be a sound approach to improve model quality, doing so presents a number of systems and software engineering challenges that must be overcome.

Transformer models consistently obtain state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks, including object detection and video classification. In contrast to standard convolutional approaches that process images pixel-by-pixel, the Vision Transformers (ViT) treat an image as a sequence of patch tokens (i.e., a smaller part, or “patch”, of an image made up of multiple pixels). This means that at every layer, a ViT model recombines and processes patch tokens based on relations between each pair of tokens, using multi-head self-attention. In doing so, ViT models have the capability to construct a global representation of the entire image. 
At the input-level, the tokens are fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring Cloud 2021.0.0 is finally out and with it you have Spring Cloud Function 3.2

While the full list of features, enhancements and bug fixes is available here, I’d like to call out few of them in this post and provide some details.
gRPC Support

In addition to an already existing support for invoking function via AWS Lambda, RSocket, Spring Cloud Stream etc., Spring Cloud Function now allows you to invoke function via gRPC.
Two ways to benefit from it. 
Spring Message

Given the wide adaption of Spring Messaging, one way of benefiting from gRPC support is by embracing Spring’s Message.
Spring Cloud Function provides GrpcSpringMessage schema modeled after Spring’s Message. It is internally converted to Spring Message to benefit from all of the existing support for Spring Messaging.

In recent years, pre-trained language models, such as BERT and GPT-3, have seen widespread use in natural language processing (NLP). By training on large volumes of text, language models acquire broad knowledge about the world, achieving strong performance on various NLP benchmarks. These models, however, are often opaque in that it may not be clear why they perform so well, which limits further hypothesis-driven improvement of the models. Hence, a new line of scientific inquiry has arisen: what linguistic knowledge is contained in these models? 
 While there are many types of linguistic knowledge that one may want to investigate, a topic that provides a strong basis for analysis is the subject–verb ag…]]></summary>

Most reinforcement learning (RL) and sequential decision making algorithms require an agent to generate training data through large amounts of interactions with their environment to achieve optimal performance. This is highly inefficient, especially when generating those interactions is difficult, such as collecting data with a real robot or by interacting with a human expert. This issue can be mitigated by reusing external sources of knowledge, for example, the RL Unplugged Atari dataset, which includes data of a synthetic agent playing Atari games.

For many concepts, there is no direct one-to-one translation from one language to another, and even when there is, such translations often carry different associations and connotations that are easily lost for a non-native speaker.

In English, one often associates a bride in a white dress and a groom in a tuxedo, but when translated into Hindi (शादी), a more appropriate association may be a bride wearing vibrant colors and a groom wearing a sherwani. What each person associates with the word may vary considerably, but if they are shown an image of the intended concep…]]></summary>

Despite considerable progress in robot learning over the past several years, some policies for robotic agents can still struggle to decisively choose actions when trying to imitate precise or complex behaviors. Consider a task in which a robot tries to slide a block across a table to precisely position it into a slot. There are many possible ways to solve this task, each requiring precise movements and corrections. The robot must commit to just one of these options, but must also be capable of changing plans each time the block ends up sliding farther than expected. Although one might expect such a task to be easy, that is often not the case for modern learning-based robots, which often le…]]></summary>

Illiteracy affects at least 773 million people globally, both young and old. For these individuals, reading information from unfamiliar sources or on unfamiliar topics can be extremely difficult. Unfortunately, these inequalities have been further magnified by the global pandemic as a result of unequal access to education in reading and writing. In fact, UNESCO reports that over 100 million children are falling behind the minimum proficiency level in reading due to COVID-related school closures.  
 With increasing world-wide access to technology, reading on a device, such as a tablet or phone, has largely taken the place of traditional formats. This provides a unique opportunity to observe reading interactions, e.g., how a reader scrolls th…]]></summary>

 Reinforcement learning (RL) is an area of machine learning that focuses on learning from experiences to solve decision making tasks. While the field of RL has made great progress, resulting in impressive empirical results on complex tasks, such as playing video games, flying stratospheric balloons and designing hardware chips, it is becoming increasingly apparent that the current standards for empirical evaluation might give a false sense of fast scientific progress while slowing it down. 
  To that end, in “Deep RL at the Edge of the Statistical Precipice”, accepted as an oral presentation at NeurIPS 2021, we discuss how statistical uncertainty of results needs t…]]></summary>

Deep learning has successfully been applied to a wide range of important challenges, such as cancer prevention and increasing accessibility. The application of deep learning models to weather forecasts can be relevant to people on a day-to-day basis, from helping people plan their day to managing food production, transportation systems, or the energy grid. Weather forecasts typically rely on traditional physics-based techniques powered by the world’s largest supercomputers. Such methods are constrained by high computational requirements and are sensitive to approximations of the physical laws on which they are based.  
 Deep learning offers a new approach to computing forecasts. Rather than incorporating explicit physical law…]]></summary>
