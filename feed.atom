Over the last several years, we have seen significant progress in applying machine learning to robotics. However, robotic systems today are capable of executing only very short, hard-coded commands, such as “Pick up an apple,” because they tend to perform best with clear tasks and rewards. They struggle with learning to perform long-horizon tasks and reasoning about abstract goals, such as a user prompt like “I just worked out, can you get me a healthy snack?” 
Meanwhile, recent progress in training language models (LMs) has led to systems that can perform a wide range of language understanding and generation tasks with impressive results. However, these language models are inherently not grounded i…]]></summary>

Apache Pulsar is a popular messaging system with a growing ecosystem of developers in the enterprise messaging and streaming space. Here are some main features and advantages of using Apache Pulsar for messaging-based software applications:


  
Apache Pulsar provides both the traditional queuing semantics of RabbitMQ, ActiveMQ, and others and the log-based structure of Apache Kafka through various subscription models.

What does happiness mean to you? It’s an emotion that is totally dependent on the individual—what makes one person happy might not affect another in the same way. But, what’s universally true is the right to be happy at work. 
We spend a good amount of our day at work and we deserve to find satisfaction in what we do, our jobs, and our daily interactions. As the COVID-19 pandemic progressed and more and more companies allowed a flexible work schedule, that flexibility has become an even more important driver of workplace well-being. In fact, the 2022 World Happiness Report states that workers have come to value time and location flexibility more than ever before.

Does your organization consider your tech stack a competitive edge? It should. The right technology empowers your business to offer goods and services that your customers want, in a way that others in your industry can’t match.

Yet the answer to increased revenues isn’t a “good enough” ecommerce experience; the same study also showed that “68% of online shoppers made unplanned purchases based on tailored product recommendations.” Investing in cutting edge personalization and rec…]]></summary>

Ranking is a core problem across a variety of domains, such as search engines, recommendation systems, or question answering. As such, researchers often utilize learning-to-rank (LTR), a set of supervised machine learning techniques that optimize for the utility of an entire list of items (rather than a single item at a time). A noticeable recent focus is on combining LTR with deep learning. Existing libraries, most notably TF-Ranking, offer researchers and practitioners the necessary tools to use LTR in their work. However, none of the existing LTR libraries work natively with JAX, a new machine learning framework that provides an extensible system of function transformations that compose: automatic different…]]></summary>

Not so long ago, I woke up every morning focused on one thing: finding and exploiting vulnerabilities.

During my 10 years working for the U.S. National Security Agency (NSA), my single objective was to identify and exploit networks to collect foreign intelligence. I was fortunate to work alongside the world’s best professional vulnerability and exploit developers. My time serving my government was formative and humbling. I learned impossible challenges are possible through unwavering persistence and patience.


But that was more than a decade ago. Now I sit on the other side of the table. I work with amazing people to build defensive cybersecurity software that protects the world’s data from attack.

The release team comprises around 30 people across six subteams - Bug Triage, CI Signal, Enhancements, Release Notes, Communications, and Docs.  Each of these subteams manages a component of the release. This post will focus on the role of the enhancements subteam and how you can get involved.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It has been almost 4 years since the last set of Spring Web Flow releases. Nevertheless, the project continues to serve a specific need particularly well, arguably better than alternatives, and remains in active use. While there hasn’t been a strong driver for new releases, the upcoming Spring Framework 6 brings a Java 17 baseline and makes the shift to Jakarta EE, which creates the need for such a release in order to enable applications to migrate to this new baseline.

Today I’m pleased to announce the availability of Spring Web Flow 3.0 M1 in the Spring milestone repository. This release focuses mainly on compatibility with Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE. The Travel booking-mvc sample on spring-projects/spring-webflow-samples has been updated and the commit history provides example changes. One significant change is the need to remove Tiles which has not migrated to Jakarta EE. In the sample, Thymeleaf Layouts is used instead.

Note that Spring Faces is not included in the release due to its deep integration with JSF and the additional time and effort required to migrate. Please, reach out if you have experience with Web Flow and JSF and are interested to help out with the migration of Spring Faces to Spring Framework 6 and Jakarta EE.

If you have a Web Flow application and you plan to migrate to Spring Framework 6, please give this milestone a try and provide feedback through the project issue tracker. Special thanks to Ian Young and Scott Cantor for their substantial contributions to this release!]]></summary>

When R-KOM was founded in 1997, its shareholders pooled their telecommunications infrastructure, which had evolved over decades with utility networks for water, electricity, and gas. Initially, R-KOM’s services were limited to business and the public sector, but now it has developed further in line with demand. Over the years, the company’s high-performance infrastructure and a broad range of products have grown. Today, R-KOM has a number of city networks in Eastern Bavaria...

It's a great time to be an online retailer. But it's also more challenging than ever. 

In 2022, global ecommerce sales are projected to exceed $5.4 trillion, continuing a pattern of explosive growth that was accelerated by the pandemic. Yet, competition is intense and expectations are high, while customer loyalty is extremely fluid. If people can't easily find what they're looking for on your site, they'll buy it somewhere else — and they might never return.

A Harris Poll survey of 10,000 customers worldwide found that 76% abandoned a retailer after failing to find a product they wanted. Roughly half ended up buying the product elsewhere. Per the study, search abandonment costs U.S. retailers an estimated $333 billion each year.

Video is an ubiquitous source of media content that touches on many aspects of people’s day-to-day lives. Increasingly, real-world video applications, such as video captioning, video content analysis, and video question-answering (VideoQA), rely on models that can connect video content with text or natural language. VideoQA is particularly challenging, however, as it requires grasping both semantic information, such as objects in a scene, as well as temporal information, e.g., how things move and interact, both of which must be taken in the context of a natural-language question that holds specific intent. In addition, because videos have many frames, processing all of them to learn spatio-temp…]]></summary>

Computer vision models see daily application for a wide variety of tasks, ranging from object recognition to image-based 3D object reconstruction. One challenging type of computer vision problem is instance-level recognition (ILR) — given an image of an object, the task is to not only determine the generic category of an object (e.g., an arch), but also the specific instance of the object (”Arc de Triomphe de l'Étoile, Paris, France”).  
Previously, ILR was tackled using deep learning approaches. First, a large set of images was collected. Then a deep model was trained to embed each image into a high-dimensional space where similar images have similar representations. Finally, the …]]></summary>

As Kubernetes grows and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced with improvements for the health of the project. Kubernetes v1.25 includes several major changes and one major removal.
The Kubernetes API Removal and Deprecation process
The Kubernetes project has a well-documented deprecation policy for features. This policy states that stable APIs may only be deprecated when a newer, stable version of that same API is available and that APIs have a minimum lifetime for each stability level. A deprecated API is one that has been marked for removal in a future Kubernetes release; it will continue to function until removal (at least one year from the deprecation), but usage will result in a warning being displayed.

Deep learning models for visual tasks (e.g., image classification) are usually trained end-to-end with data from a single visual domain (e.g., natural images or computer generated images). Typically, an application that completes visual tasks for multiple domains would need to build multiple models for each individual domain, train them independently (meaning no data is shared between domains), and then at inference time each model would process domain-specific input data. However, early layers between these models generate similar features, even for different domains, so it can be more efficient — decreasing latency and power consumption, lower memory overhead to store parameter…]]></summary>

The increasing demand for machine learning (ML) model inference on-device (for mobile devices, tablets, etc.) is driven by the rise of compute-intensive applications, the need to keep certain data on device for privacy and security reasons, and the desire to provide services when a network connection may not be available. However, on-device inference introduces a myriad of challenges, ranging from modeling to platform support requirements. These challenges relate to how different architectures are designed to optimize memory and computation, while still trying to maintain the quality of the model. From a platform perspective, the issue is identifying operations and building on top of them in a way that can generalize well across …]]></summary>

Introduction
The official documentation is the go-to source for any open source project. For Kubernetes,
it's an ever-evolving Special Interest Group (SIG) with people constantly putting in their efforts
to make details about the project easier to consume for new contributors and users. SIG Docs publishes
the official documentation on kubernetes.io which includes,
but is not limited to, documentation of the core APIs, core architectural details, and CLI tools
shipped with the Kubernetes release.
To learn more about the work of SIG Docs and its future ahead in shaping the community, I have summarised
my conversation with the co-chairs, Divya Mohan (DM),

While model design and training data are key ingredients in a deep neural network’s (DNN’s) success, less-often discussed is the specific optimization method used for updating the model parameters (weights). Training DNNs involves minimizing a loss function that measures the discrepancy between the ground truth labels and the model’s predictions. Training is carried out by backpropagation, which adjusts the model weights via gradient descent steps. Gradient descent, in turn, updates the weights by using the gradient (i.e., derivative) of the loss with respect to the weights. 
The simplest weight update corresponds to stochastic gradient descent, which, in every step, moves the weights…]]></summary>

This version is compatible with 2020.0.6 Spring Cloud release, but it’s not included in the bom, so it has to be set up manually in project build files.
Notable Changes in the 3.0.8 Release

This is primarily a bugfix and documentation release, that backports fixes over from 3.1.x releases. The most notable backport is the Fix related to cascading Spring Data’s Page deserialisation.]]></summary>

In natural conversations, we don't say people's names every time we speak to each other. Instead, we rely on contextual signaling mechanisms to initiate conversations, and eye contact is often all it takes. Google Assistant, now available in more than 95 countries and over 29 languages, has primarily relied on a hotword mechanism ("Hey Google" or “OK Google”) to help more than 700 million people every month get things done across Assistant devices. As virtual assistants become an integral part of our everyday lives, we're developing ways to initiate conversations more naturally.

The increasing complexity of code poses a key challenge to productivity in software engineering. Code completion has been an essential tool that has helped mitigate this complexity in integrated development environments (IDEs). Conventionally, code completion suggestions are implemented with rule-based semantic engines (SEs), which typically have access to the full repository and understand its semantic structure. Recent research has demonstrated that large language models (e.g., Codex and PaLM) enable longer and more complex code suggestions, and as a result, useful products have emerged (e.g., Copilot).

Nelson said, “Oftentimes the code works, but doesn’t conform to naming conventions, or is missing labels, or has security issues, which impacts downstream workflows and applications. We need the environment to conform to our policies, and I don’t want my staff burning cycles to ensure that this is the case.” This was the reason why he brought me in to run a proof of concept (POC).

Current deep reinforcement learning (RL) methods can train specialist artificial agents that excel at decision-making on various individual tasks in specific environments, such as Go or StarCraft. However, little progress has been made to extend these results to generalist agents that would not only be capable of performing many different tasks, but also upon a variety of environments with potentially distinct embodiments.

Therefore, you must be able to accurately express all the things happening in your business processes for proper end-to-end process orchestration.

If your orchestration tool does not provide those advanced workflow patterns, you will experience confusion amongst developers, you will need to implement time-consuming workarounds, and you will end up with confusing models.
