        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Joel Shor, Staff Software Engineer, Google Research   
In recent years, we have seen dramatic improvements on lexical tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, machine systems still struggle to understand paralinguistic aspects — such as tone, emotion, whether a speaker is wearing a mask, etc. Understanding these aspects represents one of the remaining difficult problems in machine hearing. In addition, state-of-the-art results often come from ultra-large models trained on private data, making them impractical to run on mobile devices or to release publicly.  
 In “Universal Paralinguistic Speech Representations Using Self-Supervised Conformers”, to appear in ICASSP 2022, we introduce CAP12— the 12th layer of a 600M parameter model trained on the YT-U training da…]]></summary>

The violence in Ukraine and the displacement of its people is a travesty and humanitarian crisis. We stand by them as they defend themselves against the senseless aggression by the Russian military on their sovereign homeland. 
In light of this, I want to share the actions that Elastic is taking to support the people of Ukraine:
First, until further notice, we will no longer sell our products to companies in Russia.  
Second, we are doubling the match of employee donations to support the humanitarian efforts underway. Additionally, every Elastician receives a week of volunteer time off, which can be used to help support Ukrainian relief efforts.
Third, because Ukraine faces an unprecedented attack on the ground and cyberattacks against critical infrastructure, we are offering free access to Elastic Cloud solutions for organizations in Ukraine. 
This free access includes platinum Elastic Security capabilities to prevent destructive malware and ransomware attacks, such as HERMETICWIPER, and it protects critical resources. It also includes advanced threat hunting to identify any malware that may lay latent in the environment.
Organizations can gain immediate access to these cloud services in the Elastic cloud portal. We are working with organizations in need to extend access. 
It’s been heartbreaking to watch the people of Ukraine as they’re forced to flee their own homes, separate from their families, and take up arms to patrol the streets of their cities. My thoughts are with everyone impacted regardless of background or nationality, hoping for a fast and peaceful resolution.]]></summary>

The history of Oak Ridge National Laboratory, tucked in the hills of Tennessee, was once a top secret government facility working on unlocking the secrets of atomic energy.
These days, the lab, while still maintaining programs researching nuclear science, has a much broader mandate, studying everything from biological and environmental systems to clean energy to the structure of the COVID-19 virus.
Underpinning nearly everything Oak Ridge studies is its supercomputing program, where world class researchers push the limits of computational power in service of scientific advancement. 
And underpinning Oak Ridge’s supercomputers, helping to keep them stable and performant, is technology from Elastic. Oak Ridge’s latest supercomputer, Summit, was deployed in 2018 and has a peak performance o…]]></summary>

Think about the moments when something is presented to you that is just what you’re looking for. Those moments, when it feels like a company you trust knows you, are all too rare in commerce. And of course, presented incorrectly, they can even feel invasive. But done well, they solidify your relationship as a customer, and reinforce that you’re getting the service you deserve. 
But let’s flip that around — how can you help your organization deliver that kind of personalized experience to your customers?

Proteins are essential molecules found in all living things. They play a central role in our bodies’ structure and function, and they are also featured in many products that we encounter every day, from medications to household items like laundry detergent. Each protein is a chain of amino acid building blocks, and just as an image may include multiple objects, like a dog and a cat, a protein may also have multiple components, which are called protein domains. Understanding the relationship between a protein’s amino acid sequence — for example, its domains — and its structure or function are long-standing challenges with far-reaching scientific implications.

Action recognition has become a major focus area for the research community because many applications can benefit from improved modeling, such as video retrieval, video captioning, video question-answering, etc. Transformer-based approaches have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. While Transformer models require data to learn better visual priors compared to ConvNets, action recognition datasets are relatively small in scale. Large Transformer models are typically first trained on image datasets and later fine-tuned on a target action recognition dataset. 
 While the current pre-training and fine-tuning action recognition paradigm is stra…]]></summary>

Recently, we have seen several malware campaigns attacking Ukrainian organizations — Operation Bleeding Bear is a recent one of note. Elastic Security researchers recently verified a data wiper malware campaign that is targeting Ukrainian systems. As this malware campaign is new, with more information being uncovered hourly, it is being referred to as HERMETICWIPER. 
When engaged on a file system, HERMETICWIPER tampers with the boot process to render a system unusable and unbootable. HERMETICWIPER’s goals are to make the system unbootable and wipe data from the file system. Malware wipers are a common tactic of adversaries. They are mainly designed to wipe the contents of drives and render that drive useless. Read our full article to learn more.
There are several Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) that have been associated with HERMETICWIPER and the Elastic Security solution is able to automatically detect and block this malware. Other security vendors have also verified this malware as well. 
As this is a rapidly evolving campaign, expect Elastic Security to produce more on this topic. Existing Elastic Security users can access these capabilities within the product. If you’re new to Elastic Security, take a look at our Quick Start guides (bite-sized training videos to get you started quickly) or our free fundamentals training courses. If you want to try the product, you started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud.]]></summary>

In 2017, Google introduced federated learning (FL), an approach that enables mobile devices to collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models while keeping the raw training data on each user's device, decoupling the ability to do ML from the need to store the data in the cloud. Since its introduction, Google has continued to actively engage in FL research and deployed FL to power many features in Gboard, including next word prediction, emoji suggestion and out-of-vocabulary word discovery. Federated learning is improving the “Hey Google” detection models in Assistant, suggesting replies in Google Messages, predicting text selections, and more.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Abhishek Kumar and Ehsan Amid, Research Scientists, Google Research, Brain Team 
Over the past several years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been quite successful in driving impressive performance gains in several real-world applications, from image recognition to genomics. However, modern DNNs often have far more trainable model parameters than the number of training examples and the resulting overparameterized networks can easily overfit to noisy or corrupted labels (i.e., examples that are assigned a wrong class label). As a consequence, training with noisy labels often leads to degradation in accuracy of the trained model on clean test data. Unfortunately, noisy labels can appear in several real-world scenarios due to multiple factors, such as errors and inconsistencies in …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
Version 7.17.1 of the Elastic Stack was released today. We recommend you upgrade to this latest version. We recommend 7.17.1 over the previous patch versions in 7.17.x.

The 7.17.1 patch release contains a fix for a potential security vulnerability. Please see our security advisory for more details.

This version also contains fixes for a number of problems in the 7.17 to 8.x upgrade experience, and we strongly recommend anyone upgrading to 8.x should upgrade to this version, 7.17.1, *before* running the upgrade assistant. If not, you could encounter one of the known pre-upgrade migration problems that are fixed in 7.17.1. These fixed problems include the following, although there are others:

Nodes would not start up if shut down part way through system index migration.
System index migration might not run if it had previously suffered from errors.
Migration of the internal .tasks index would fail if it was originally created in 6.x.


For full details of the issues that have been fixed in this version, please see the release notes.
For a full list of changes for each product, please refer to the release notes:

While not immediately obvious, all of us experience the world in four dimensions (4D). For example, when walking or driving down the street we observe a stream of visual inputs, snapshots of the 3D world, which, when taken together in time, creates a 4D visual input. Today’s autonomous vehicles and robots are able to capture much of this information through various onboard sensing mechanisms, such as LiDAR and cameras. 
 LiDAR is a ubiquitous sensor that uses light pulses to reliably measure the 3D coordinates of objects in a scene, however, it is also sparse and has a limited range — the farther one is from a sensor, the fewer points will be returned. This means that far-away objects might only get a hand…]]></summary>

It does so by using Iterable and not List, as one might expect.
In many cases, that is of no consequence, since you typically want to iterate over the result anyway.
However, you might occasionally prefer a List. In these cases, Iterable is annoying.



I will write more about why that choice was made in the first place and how you can deal with it as long as you are on Spring Data 2.x. However, let me get the good news out first:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[In Spring Security 5.7.0-M2 we deprecated the WebSecurityConfigurerAdapter, as we encourage users to move towards a component-based security configuration.

To assist with the transition to this new style of configuration, we have compiled a list of common use-cases and the suggested alternatives going forward.

In the examples below we follow best practice by using the Spring Security lambda DSL and the method HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests to define our authorization rules. If you are new to the lambda DSL you can read about it in this blog post. If you would like to learn more about why we choose to use HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests you can check out the reference documentation.

In the world of networks, there are models that can explain observations across a diverse collection of applications. These include simple tasks such as computing the shortest path, which has obvious applications to routing networks but also applies in biology, e.g., where the slime mold Physarum is able to find shortest paths in mazes. Another example is Braess’s paradox — the observation that adding resources to a network can have an effect opposite to the one expected — which manifests not only in road networks but also in mechanical and electrical systems. For instance, constructing a new road can increase traffic congestion or adding a new link in an electrical circuit can increase voltage. Such connec…]]></summary>

  Mechanical ventilators provide critical support for patients who have difficulty breathing or are unable to breathe on their own. They see frequent use in scenarios ranging from routine anesthesia, to neonatal intensive care and life support during the COVID-19 pandemic. A typical ventilator consists of a compressed air source, valves to control the flow of air into and out of the lungs, and a "respiratory circuit" that connects the ventilator to the patient. In some cases, a sedated patient may be connected to the ventilator via a tube inserted through the trachea to their lungs, a process called invasive ventilation.

Machine learning (ML) has become prominent in information technology, which has led some to raise concerns about the associated rise in the costs of computation, primarily the carbon footprint, i.e., total greenhouse gas emissions. While these assertions rightfully elevated the discussion around carbon emissions in ML, they also highlight the need for accurate data to assess true carbon footprint, which can help identify strategies to mitigate carbon emission in ML.

In recent years, machine learning (ML) competitions in health have attracted ML scientists to work together to solve challenging clinical problems. These competitions provide access to relevant data and well-defined problems where experienced data scientists come to compete for solutions and learn new methods. However, a fundamental difficulty in organizing such challenges is obtaining and curating high quality datasets for model development and independent datasets for model evaluation.

Large pre-trained language models, which are continuing to grow in size, achieve state-of-art results on many natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks. Since the development of GPT and BERT, standard practice has been to fine-tune models on downstream tasks, which involves adjusting every weight in the network (i.e., model tuning). However, as models become larger, storing and serving a tuned copy of the model for each downstream task becomes impractical. 
 An appealing alternative is to share across all downstream tasks a single frozen pre-trained language model, in which all weights are fixed. In an exciting development, GPT-3 showed convincingly that a frozen model can be conditio…]]></summary>

In visual understanding, the Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants have received significant attention recently due to their superior performance on many core visual applications, such as image classification, object detection, and video understanding. The core idea of ViT is to utilize the power of self-attention layers to learn global relationships between small patches of images. However, the number of connections between patches increases quadratically with image size. Such a design has been observed to be data inefficient — although the original ViT can perform better than convolutional networks with hundreds of millions of images for pre-training, such a data requirement is not always practical, and it sti…]]></summary>

People learn to do things by watching others — from mimicking new dance moves, to watching YouTube cooking videos. We’d like robots to do the same, i.e., to learn new skills by watching people do things during training. Today, however, the predominant paradigm for teaching robots is to remote control them using specialized hardware for teleoperation and then train them to imitate pre-recorded demonstrations. This limits both who can provide the demonstrations (programmers & roboticists) and where they can be provided (lab settings). If robots could instead self-learn new tasks by watching humans, this capability could allow them to be deployed in more unstructured settings like the home, and ma…]]></summary>

Continuing advances in the design and implementation of datacenter (DC) accelerators for machine learning (ML), such as TPUs and GPUs, have been critical for powering modern ML models and applications at scale. These improved accelerators exhibit peak performance (e.g., FLOPs) that is orders of magnitude better than traditional computing systems. However, there is a fast-widening gap between the available peak performance offered by state-of-the-art hardware and the actual achieved performance when ML models run on that hardware.  
 One approach to address this gap is to design hardware-specific ML models that optimize both performance (e.g., throughput and latency) and model quality. Recen…]]></summary>
