Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline. When providing care, clinicians routinely interpret data from a wide range of modalities including medical images, clinical notes, lab tests, electronic health records, genomics, and more.  Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations. The inputs to these systems tend to be complex data such as images, and they typically provide structured outputs, whether in the form of discrete grades o…]]></summary>

This year at Summit, an attendee posed a question about how to work with setting facts and changing data in Ansible. Many times we’ve come across people using task after task to manipulate data, to turn items into lists, filter our options, trying to do heavy data manipulation and to turn data from one source into another. Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own. While many of these options will work, they aren’t very efficient or easy to implement. Ansible Playbooks were never meant for programming.]]></summary>

The Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) adopted new rules last week that require companies listed on the US Stock Exchange to disclose any material cybersecurity incidents.

In addition to reporting incidents, companies are also required to describe their approach to cybersecurity risk management, strategy, and governance on an annual basis.

The new rules are primarily intended to provide transparency to shareholders and investors, but the information within relevant SEC filings will be of interest to CISOs, security teams, and business leaders who will want answers to questions like:


What types of incidents do public companies deem material?

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
In January 2022, the Biden administration released the Improving Cybersecurity of National Security, DOD, and Intelligence Community Systems memorandum, known as NSM-8. The memorandum directs the US Department of Defense (DoD) and Intelligence Community (IC) to increase their focus on cybersecurity through unified standards and reporting. NSM-8 serves a similar purpose as Executive Order 14028 does for US civilian agencies.
The speed and success of cyber incident response can be significantly influenced by the amount and nature of data recorded in network logs, as well as how that data is retained and accessed. This was highlighted by some of the most pointed criticism of vendors following the 2019 SolarWinds/Sunburst incident and the 2021 Log4Shell vulnerability. 
Since the release of NSM-8, Elastic® has helped IC and DoD customers meet requirements through a cost-efficient, unified approach to cybersecurity, logging compliance, and data analysis.

In the short term, LLM providers may offer a patchwork of vendor-specific techniques for improving the repeatability of responses.

Fortunately, in addition to these emerging vendor-specific techniques, there's a universal pattern for structuring prompts at the start of a conversation to steer it in the right direction. We'll craft …]]></summary>

Lateral movement is a dangerous threat in the landscape of highly integrated technologies. If attackers gain access to an endpoint, it’s critical for security teams to identify any and all movements they make. To combat this threat, Elastic Security is excited to announce a new lateral movement detection package that makes use of advanced analytics.

In the past, we explored how we can detect malicious lateral file transfers using commonly abused admin tools, such as SAMBA, SMB/PS Remoting, FTP, SFTP, SSH, and SCP. But we wanted to explore further how to detect fileless malware that attackers use to hijack and compromise systems like the execution of malicious processes and the exploitation of remote services and sessions.

Elasticsearch 8.9 introduces a speedup to cardinality aggregations through support for dynamic pruning. This optimization needs specific conditions to be met to kick in, but when it does it often yields spectacular results. We have observed some cardinality aggregations that ran by as much as 1,000x faster with this change.

For instance, computing the number of unique Kubernetes deployments monitored by the Elastic Kubernetes integration benefits from this optimization:

This strategy follows in the (long) wake of ODNI’s 2017 data strategy. In the six years since the publication of that document, IC leaders say that data volume has become an increasing challenge, as well as the need for advanced data capabilities such as automation.

Deep learning has recently made tremendous progress in a wide range of problems and applications, but models often fail unpredictably when deployed in unseen domains or distributions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. 
 

Designing adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…]]></summary>

AI-related products and technologies are constructed and deployed in a societal context: that is, a dynamic and complex collection of social, cultural, historical, political and economic circumstances. Because societal contexts by nature are dynamic, complex, non-linear, contested, subjective, and highly qualitative, they are challenging to translate into the quantitative representations, methods, and practices that dominate standard machine learning (ML) approaches and responsible AI product development practices.

Learning from periodic data (signals that repeat, such as a heart beat or the daily temperature changes on Earth’s surface) is crucial for many real-world applications, from monitoring weather systems to detecting vital signs. For example, in the environmental remote sensing domain, periodic learning is often needed to enable nowcasting of environmental changes, such as precipitation patterns or land surface temperature. In the health domain, learning from video measurement has shown to extract (quasi-)periodic vital signs such as atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea episodes.

A key feature of human intelligence is that humans can learn to perform new tasks by reasoning using only a few examples. Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.

Computer Architecture research has a long history of developing simulators and tools to evaluate and shape the design of computer systems. For example, the SimpleScalar simulator was introduced in the late 1990s and allowed researchers to explore various microarchitectural ideas. Computer architecture simulators and tools, such as gem5, DRAMSys, and many more have played a significant role in advancing computer architecture research. Since then, these shared resources and infrastructure have benefited industry and academia and have enabled researchers to systematically build on each other's work, leading to significant advances in the field.

Visual question answering (VQA) is a machine learning task that requires a model to answer a question about an image or a set of images. Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot). However, there is still a significant performance gap between these methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised VQA methods, such as MaMMU…]]></summary>

Image retrieval plays a crucial role in search engines. Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging. For instance, when searching for a fashion item, users may want an item whose specific attribute, e.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website. Yet searching for the item in an existing search engine is not trivial since precisely describing the fashion item by text can be challenging. To address this fact, composed image retrieval (CIR…]]></summary>

In this blog post, we will introduce the concept of Confidential Computing (CC) to improve any computing environment's security and privacy properties. Further, we will show how
the Cloud-Native ecosystem, particularly Kubernetes, can benefit from the new compute paradigm.
Confidential Computing is a concept that has been introduced previously in the cloud-native world. The
Confidential Computing Consortium (CCC) is a project community in the Linux Foundation
that already worked on
Defining and Enabling Confidential Computing.
In the Whitepaper,
they provide a great motivation for the use of Confidential Computing:
