As the world experiences the AI gold rush, organizations are increasingly turning to enterprise AI solutions to gain a competitive edge and unlock new opportunities.

As businesses embrace the power of AI, they must be vigilant in safeguarding sensitive data to avoid potential disasters. 
In this blog post, we will delve into the insights from two thought-provoking articles to highlight the top six considerations that organizations should focus on while implementing enterprise AI solutions.

Government and education leaders estimate that data volume at their organizations will increase by 59% over the next three years. Although having more information than you need is (arguably) better than not having it when you need it, the sheer volume of data can make it challenging for teams to pinpoint exactly what data will bring value to their mission goals.

Elastic and ThoughtLab recently released a global study that focuses on how organizations are extracting value from data — data from sources including cybersecurity (SIEM), logs, administrative, IoT, application traces, and more. Out of all industries included in the study, public sector ranks the lowest in what ThoughtLab refers to as “data maturity” — based on a framework of best practices, such as data operations, culture, an…]]></summary>

Creating events that employees actually want to engage in can be difficult, especially as a distributed by design company with Elasticians in more than 40 countries around the world. But, Corey’s goal is to give people choices and let them decide what works best for them.

Learning from periodic data (signals that repeat, such as a heart beat or the daily temperature changes on Earth’s surface) is crucial for many real-world applications, from monitoring weather systems to detecting vital signs. For example, in the environmental remote sensing domain, periodic learning is often needed to enable nowcasting of environmental changes, such as precipitation patterns or land surface temperature. In the health domain, learning from video measurement has shown to extract (quasi-)periodic vital signs such as atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea episodes.

SIEM (security information and event management) migration is rarely easy. However, when budget constraints, performance issues, or new requirements to further reduce organizational risk lead you down that path, it’s often a good idea to investigate ways to simplify the process. Elastic® and Cribl® have partnered to provide our customers with tools that simplify the process and provide ongoing value to your security operation.

This blog explores some of the ways Elastic and Cribl can be leveraged together to make SIEM migration easier for our customers: reducing migration services costs, eliminating friction, and decreasing time to value as we help customers modernize their security operations.

Part 1 talks about the concept of a nation-state and then provides a high-level overview of Locked Shields — the world's largest cybersecurity exercise — and its increasingly important role in promoting cyber warfare readiness for NATO member states and partners. Part 1 also outlines the steps taken by nations to prepare for a cyber warfare exercise. Forthcoming, Part 2 will go in depth into the Locked Shields cybersecurity exercise and how Elastic Security can be leveraged to help protect, detect, and respond to threats in a cyber warfare exercise.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
The term index is quite overloaded in the tech world. If you asked most developers what an index is, they might tell you it commonly refers to a data structure in a relational database (RDBMS) that is associated with a table, which improves the speed of data retrieval operations.

But what is an Elasticsearch® index? An Elasticsearch index is a logical namespace that holds a collection of documents, where each document is a collection of fields — which, in turn, are key-value pairs that contain your data.
POST /playwrights/_doc/1
{
  "firstname": "William",
  "lastname": "Shakespeare"
},
We can further add documents and fields as we like, which is not something you could do easily with a relational database.
POST /playwrights/_doc/2
{
  "firstname": "Samuel",
  "lastname": "Beckett",
  "year_of_birth": 1906
},
Now we can query out all the documents using the search endpoint.
GET /playwrights/_search
{
    "query": {
        "match_all": {}
    }
},
Or we can query for a specific year of birth.
GET /playwrights/_search
{
    "query": {
        “match": {
            “year_of_birth": 1906
        }
    }
},
In addition to basic querying, Elasticsearch provides advanced search features like fuzzy matching, stemming, relevance scoring, highlighting, and tokenization which breaks text down into smaller chunks, called tokens. In most cases, these tokens are individual words but there are many different tokenizers available.

Splunk is good at getting data into the platform, specifically unstructured data from log files and API endpoints. It was built on the design principle of schema on read. The benefit to the schema on read design principle is that it theoretically allows you to quickly onboard any unstructured data source so that you can search it, analyze the results, and subsequently perform some action. The tradeoff that’s realized with schema on read is that it inherently adds latency…]]></summary>

Kibana alerting has been around for quite some time, and major work is going on to give you better views into what each rule is doing and where it’s spending its time.

However, there are always questions left, where you just want more. Maybe you are an SRE at a company and need to look over hundreds of clusters. Our built-in dashboards might not suffice, as you need a more granular approach.

Good news! We have been working internally to improve the insights you can gather with APM in Kibana®. Simply activate APM for Kibana with a few configuration steps. This will enable Kibana Real User Monitoring (RUM) and Kibana itself. Additionally, you can opt-in to activate Elasticsearch® instrumentation and get a deeper understanding of where Elasticsearch is spending its time.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Jerry Wei, Student Researcher, and Denny Zhou, Principal Scientist, Google Research





A key feature of human intelligence is that humans can learn to perform new tasks by reasoning using only a few examples. Scaling up language models has unlocked a range of new applications and paradigms in machine learning, including the ability to perform challenging reasoning tasks via in-context learning. Language models, however, are still sensitive to the way that prompts are given, indicating that they are not reasoning in a robust manner. For instance, language models often require heavy prompt engineering or phrasing tasks as instructions, and they exhibit unexpected behaviors such as performance on tasks being unaffected even when shown incorrect labels.

Computer Architecture research has a long history of developing simulators and tools to evaluate and shape the design of computer systems. For example, the SimpleScalar simulator was introduced in the late 1990s and allowed researchers to explore various microarchitectural ideas. Computer architecture simulators and tools, such as gem5, DRAMSys, and many more have played a significant role in advancing computer architecture research. Since then, these shared resources and infrastructure have benefited industry and academia and have enabled researchers to systematically build on each other's work, leading to significant advances in the field.

Visual question answering (VQA) is a machine learning task that requires a model to answer a question about an image or a set of images. Conventional VQA approaches need a large amount of labeled training data consisting of thousands of human-annotated question-answer pairs associated with images. In recent years, advances in large-scale pre-training have led to the development of VQA methods that perform well with fewer than fifty training examples (few-shot) and without any human-annotated VQA training data (zero-shot). However, there is still a significant performance gap between these methods and state-of-the-art fully supervised VQA methods, such as MaMMU…]]></summary>

Image retrieval plays a crucial role in search engines. Typically, their users rely on either image or text as a query to retrieve a desired target image. However, text-based retrieval has its limitations, as describing the target image accurately using words can be challenging. For instance, when searching for a fashion item, users may want an item whose specific attribute, e.g., the color of a logo or the logo itself, is different from what they find in a website. Yet searching for the item in an existing search engine is not trivial since precisely describing the fashion item by text can be challenging. To address this fact, composed image retrieval (CIR…]]></summary>

In recent years, diffusion models have shown great success in text-to-image generation, achieving high image quality, improved inference performance, and expanding our creative inspiration. Nevertheless, it is still challenging to efficiently control the generation, especially with conditions that are difficult to describe with text.



Today, we announce MediaPipe diffusion plugins, which enable controllable text-to-image generation to be run on-device. Expanding upon our prior work on GPU inference for on-device large generative models, we introduce new low-cost solutions for controllable text-to-image generation that can be plugged into existing diffusion models and their Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) variants.

The Kubernetes community has been signing their container image-based artifacts
since release v1.24. While the graduation of the corresponding enhancement
from alpha to beta in v1.26 introduced signatures for the binary artifacts,
other projects followed the approach by providing image signatures for their
releases, too. This means that they either create the signatures within their
own CI/CD pipelines, for example by using GitHub actions, or rely on the
Kubernetes image promotion process to automatically sign the images by
proposing pull requests to the k/k8s.io repository. A requirement for
using this process is that the project is part of the kubernetes or

Pre-training visual language (VL) models on web-scale image-caption datasets has recently emerged as a powerful alternative to traditional pre-training on image classification data. Image-caption datasets are considered to be more “open-domain” because they contain broader scene types and vocabulary words, which result in models with strong performance in few- and zero-shot recognition tasks. However, images with fine-grained class descriptions can be rare, and the class distribution can be imbalanced since image-caption datasets do not go through manual curation. By contrast, large-scale classification datasets, such as ImageNet, are often curated and can thus provide fine-…]]></summary>

Deploying Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform Foundation
 
The steps below detail how to install Ansible Automation Platform on AWS United States GovCloud from the AWS Marketplace. The steps to deploy into AWS GovCloud and AWS Commercial cloud are nearly identical. Before starting your deployment process, please ensure the AWS account you are using to deploy has the following IAM roles. These IAM roles are required to deploy the AWS foundation stack offering. The foundation stack offering here refers to the base Ansible Automation Platform 2 deployment.]]></summary>

Caching is a ubiquitous idea in computer science that significantly improves the performance of storage and retrieval systems by storing a subset of popular items closer to the client based on request patterns. An important algorithmic piece of cache management is the decision policy used for dynamically updating the set of items being stored, which has been extensively optimized over several decades, resulting in several efficient and robust heuristics. While applying machine learning to cache policies has shown promising results in recent years (e.g., LRB, LHD, storage applications), it remains a challenge to outperform robust heuristics in a way that can generalize reliably beyond benchmar…]]></summary>

The recent progress in generative AI unlocked the possibility of creating new content in several different domains, including text, vision and audio. These models often rely on the fact that raw data is first converted to a compressed format as a sequence of tokens. In the case of audio, neural audio codecs (e.g., SoundStream or EnCodec) can efficiently compress waveforms to a compact representation, which can be inverted to reconstruct an approximation of the original audio signal. Such a representation consists of a sequence of discrete audio tokens, capturing the local properties of sounds (e.g., phonemes) and their temporal structure (e.g., prosody). By re…]]></summary>
