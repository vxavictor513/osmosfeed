Economics, combinatorics, physics, and signal processing conspire to make it difficult to design, build, and operate high-quality, cost-effective wireless networks. The radio transceivers that communicate with our mobile phones, the equipment that supports them (such as power and wired networking), and the physical space they occupy are all expensive, so it’s important to be judicious in choosing sites for new transceivers. Even when the set of available sites is limited, there are exponentially many possible networks that can be built. For example, given only 50 sites, there are 250 (over a million billion) possibilities!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
Adoption of AWS Lambda functions in cloud-native applications has increased exponentially over the past few years. Serverless functions, such as the AWS Lambda service, provide a high level of abstraction from the underlying infrastructure and orchestration, given these tasks are managed by the cloud provider. Software development teams can then focus on the implementation of business and application logic. 
Some additional benefits include billing for serverless functions based on the actual compute and memory resources consumed, along with automatic on-demand scaling. One difficulty in using serverless functions, however, is making them observable in the wider end-to-end microservices architecture context.

Today, we’re happy to announce that Elastic and Tines are partnering to help our joint users detect security threats and reduce mean time to respond. 

Many of the world’s best security teams rely on the power of Elastic’s high-speed, cloud-scale detection, prevention, and response capabilities to investigate and contain potential security threats within their environments. Many of these same teams trust Tines’ no-code automation platform to optimize their mission-critical workflows, respond to attacks at speed and scale, reduce toil on analysts, and remove the friction associated with integrations.

By combining Elastic and Tines, security teams are able to dramatically reduce dwell times, mean time to respond, and false-positive rates while also strengthening their agility and impact.

In recent years, scaling up the size of language models has been shown to be a reliable way to improve performance on a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Today’s language models at the scale of 100B or more parameters achieve strong performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation, even with little or no training examples. Even the largest language models, however, can still struggle with certain multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning. How might we enable language models to perform such reasoning tasks?

Machine translation (MT) technology has made significant advances in recent years, as deep learning has been integrated with natural language processing (NLP). Performance on research benchmarks like WMT have soared, and translation services have improved in quality and expanded to include new languages. Nevertheless, while existing translation services cover languages spoken by the majority of people world wide, they only include around 100 languages in total, just over 1% of those actively spoken globally. Moreover, the languages that are currently represented are overwhelmingly European, largely overlooking regions of high linguistic diversity, like Africa and the Americas.

It is becoming more common that adversary attacks consist of more than a standalone executable or script. Advanced attacker techniques, like “living off the land” (LotL) that appear normal in isolation become more suspicious when observed in a parent-child context. If you are running Windows in your environment, it is important to have a system for detecting these types of attacks.  Traditional heuristic-based detections, though effective in detecting a single event, often fail to generalize across a multi-step attack.  At Elastic we have trained a Living off the Land classifier, anomaly detection jobs and security detection rules to help our security professionals discover LotL attacks.

This is evidenced in her various writings and public presentations, both discussing the human experience in companies and the purpose that the company provides in the communities that it serves.

Now, this is not particularly noteworthy for those millions who already live here. But I don’t live here. I’m a visitor! I live in San Francisco. I had to fly here! On a plane! With other people! ACROSS THE OCEAN. This is my first international flight since March of 2020, and I couldn’t be more excited to be here for Devoxx UK and also just to catch up with old friends I haven’t seen in nearly three years. If you know me, and how I used to travel, you’ll appreciate how odd it is for me to be this excited to have crossed a border. It’s been sooo long! I’ve missed the process. I’ve missed seeing people. I’ve missed all of it. 

One thing I haven’t missed is a lot of this week’s new and noteworthy, which I recap in this week’s This Week in Spring roundup. Let’s goooo!

Cybersecurity strategies within cloud environments are often seen as a complicated landscape with rapidly developing technologies, architectures, and terms. Simultaneously, there are continuously motivated individuals and groups trying to utilize vulnerabilities for illicit uses such as to increase access to the data, install malware, disrupt services, and more.
More recently, a series of observed threat actors have taken advantage of Shell Evasion tactics to evade detection and target unknowing victims — often to successful outcomes given the lack of visibility most organizations have within their infrastructure.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
Yesterday, the Elastic Security Research Team released a detailed report outlining technical details regarding the BLISTER launcher, a sophisticated campaign that we uncovered in December 2021. 

This latest release continues on research we’ve developed while observing the campaign over the last few months — specifically pertaining to the technical details of how the group behind this payload is able to stay under the radar and evade detection for many new samples identified.
https://static-www.elastic.co/v3/assets/bltefdd0b53724fa2ce/blt8dac534ec320cd61/62754f3c0cffdf1eb136bf23/1-blister-loader.png,1-blister-loader.png,
Alongside this Loader research, the Elastic Security Research Team has provided a configuration extractor to allow threat researchers to continue work to discover further developments within this campaign, and expand detection capabilities for our community.

While complex, the loader research covers details around the execution flow for the campaign, and provides detailed information regarding each phase of the Loaders’ execution. The report continues to discuss nuances, signatures, and further YARA signatures for detecting this threat within any potentially impacted environment.

As Elastic Security continues to observe this threat actor group, we will provide updates to our tooling and further detailed reports regarding our findings. We wish to extend thanks to the security community for extending upon our initial findings in previous posts, and ensuring users are safe from threats such as these.
Users leveraging Elastic Security are currently protected against the known threats and vectors discussed in this post. Get started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud today.]]></summary>

The promise of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in solving complex, high-dimensional problems autonomously has attracted much interest in areas such as robotics, game playing, and self-driving cars. However, effectively training an RL policy requires exploring a large set of robot states and actions, including many that are not safe for the robot. This is a considerable risk, for example, when training a legged robot. Because such robots are inherently unstable, there is a high likelihood of the robot falling during learning, which could cause damage. 
The risk of damage can be mitigated to some extent by learning the control policy in computer simulation and then deploying it in the real world. However, this approac…]]></summary>

Graphs are very common representations of natural systems that have connected relational components, such as social networks, traffic infrastructure, molecules, and the internet. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning (ML) models for graphs that leverage their inherent connections to incorporate context into predictions about items within the graph or the graph as a whole. GNNs have been effectively used to discover new drugs, help mathematicians prove theorems, detect misinformation, and improve the accuracy of arrival time predictions in Google Maps. 
A surge of interest in GNNs during the last decade has produced thousands of GNN variants, with hundreds introduced each year. …]]></summary>

Over the last several years, the rapidly growing size of deep learning models has quickly exceeded the memory capacity of single accelerators. Earlier models like BERT (with a parameter size of < 1GB) can efficiently scale across accelerators by leveraging data parallelism in which model weights are duplicated across accelerators while only partitioning and distributing the training data. However, recent large models like GPT-3 (with a parameter size of 175GB) can only scale using model parallel training, …]]></summary>

Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics have enabled robotic agents to perform increasingly complex tasks in challenging environments. Recent results show that robots can learn to fold clothes, dexterously manipulate a rubik’s cube, sort objects by color, navigate complex environments and walk on difficult, uneven terrain. But "short-horizon" tasks such as these, which require very little long-term planning and provide immediate failure feedback, are relatively easy to train compared to many tasks that may confront a robot in a real-world setting. Unfortunately, scaling such short-horizon skills to the abstract, long horizons of real-world tasks is difficult. For example, how would one trai…]]></summary>

This week I was hoping to be in glorious Chicago, Illinois for the first in-person SpringOne Tour installment since the pandemic. But, alas, I couldn’t go because - out of an abundance of caution, and since I was exposed to COVID19 in Atlanta, GA - it was thought to be safer to keep some folks home and virtual. Sigh. This policy makes perfect sense and it’s what I wanted. But it’s still a smidge disappointing to not be there. I miss y’all! It was fun at least doing a remote presentation. 

Anyway, without further ado, let’s get into today’s roundup!

Object detection is a long-standing computer vision task that attempts to recognize and localize all objects of interest in an image. The complexity arises when trying to identify or localize all object instances while also avoiding duplication. Existing approaches, like Faster R-CNN and DETR, are carefully designed and highly customized in the choice of architecture and loss function. This specialization of existing systems has created two major barriers: (1) it adds complexity in tuning and training the different parts of the system (e.g., region proposal network, graph matching with GIOU loss, etc.), and (2), it can reduce the ability of a model to generalize, necessitating a redesign of the model for…]]></summary>

A graceful integration of devices requires adaptation to existing aesthetics and user styles rather than simply adding screens, which can easily disrupt a visual space, especially when they become monolithic surfaces or black screens when powered down or not actively used.

Form-based document understanding is a growing research topic because of its practical potential for automatically converting unstructured text data into structured information to gain insight about a document’s contents. Recent sequence modeling, which is a self-attention mechanism that directly models relationships between all words in a selection of text, has demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on natural language tasks. A natural approach to handle form document understanding tasks is to first serialize the form documents (usually in a left-to-right, top-to-bottom fashion) and then apply state-of-the-art sequence models to them.  
 However, form documents often have more complex layouts …]]></summary>

Supervised learning is a common approach to machine learning (ML) in which the model is trained using data that is labeled appropriately for the task at hand. Ordinary supervised learning trains on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, where all training examples are sampled from a fixed set of classes, and the model has access to these examples throughout the entire training phase. In contrast, continual learning tackles the problem of training a single model on changing data distributions where different classification tasks are presented sequentially. This is particularly important, for example, to enable autonomous agents to process and interpret continuous streams of informati…]]></summary>

The ability to classify images into categories has been transformed by deep learning. It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning, whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals). Previous works such as BiT and ViT employed these methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of classification tasks, such as the VTAB benchmark. 
However, fine-tuning has some downsides: though pre-training is done only once, fine-tuning is necessary on every new dataset for which task-specific data is needed. Multimo…]]></summary>
