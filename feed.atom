        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
At Elastic, many of our Elasticians love cycling and exploring new and unique patches of road. We also love data analysis and visualization. I started to plan my upcoming cycling trip on Komoot. Planning a one-week trip with six rides is tricky, as you are hovering over the map and trying to find unique routes. Who wants to ride the same road multiple times?

After I was done planning in Komoot, I thought to myself: is there a way to identify if I am riding this road once, twice, or even more often? I also wanted to plot it and look at the data a bit more dynamically.

This is our goal today. Let’s build a dashboard that shows this information.

More and more organizations are moving their infrastructure and applications to the cloud to increase productivity, drive down costs, and improve operational agility. According to Gartner, 85% of organizations will embrace a cloud-first approach by 2025 and will look to leverage cloud-native technologies wherever they can.

With the average organization deploying nearly 90 applications last year — and large organizations deploying more than 185 — employees end up jumping back and forth between apps roughly 1,200 times each day, according to a recent Harvard Business Review report. Not only does this context switching eat up a lot of time, but it also crushes productivity as employees lose focus.

I’m doing great. I’m in sunny Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, eating delicious food and hanging out with amazing people. Tomorrow, I’m off to Penang, Malaysia, for a little tourism before I get back to a more code-driven kinda fun: I’ll be doing a developer event looking at the latest-and-greatest from Spring Boot 3 here in Kuala Lumpur on the 11th of November - ten short days from now! - so please join me!

Also, I just joined Mastodon - a decentralized and open-source Twitter; I’m not leaving Twitter, of course, but I would love to make new friends and grow the community there: @starbuxman@mastodon.online! 

Anyway, my friends, housekeeping aside, we’ve got a ton of amazing things to talk about today so let’s dive right into it!

Kubernetes is becoming increasingly pervasive and a majority of these deployments will be in Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS), Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE), or Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS). Some of you may be on a single cloud while others will have the added burden of managing clusters on multiple Kubernetes cloud services. In addition to cloud provider complexity, you also have to manage hundreds of deployed services generating more and more observability and telemetry data.

With Elastic 8.5, we are excited to announce that the Cloud Workload and Posture capabilities are now generally available with this release!

As organizations move rapidly to adopt newer cloud technologies, security teams are tasked with protecting their organization’s assets and data across various platforms — including endpoints, cloud, and on-prem environments.

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

For example, in this release the version of spring-session-bom is 3.0.0-RC1.

Whether it's a professional honing their skills or a child learning to read, coaches and educators play a key role in assessing the learner's answer to a question in a given context and guiding them towards a goal. These interactions have unique characteristics that set them apart from other forms of dialogue, yet are not available when learners practice alone at home. In the field of natural language processing, this type of capability has not received much attention and is technologically challenging.

Open Images is a computer vision dataset covering ~9 million images with labels spanning thousands of object categories. Researchers around the world use Open Images to train and evaluate computer vision models. Since the initial release of Open Images in 2016, which included image-level labels covering 6k categories, we have provided multiple updates to enrich annotations and expand the potential use cases of the dataset. Through several releases, we have added image-level labels for over 20k categories on all images and bounding box annotations, visual relations, instance segmentations, and localized narratives (synchronized voice, mouse trace, and text caption) on a subset of 1.9M images.

        <link href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/25/spring-integration-6-0-0-rc1-available"/>
        <updated>2022-10-25T13:55:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Spring community,



I was so eager to find and fix bugs in the latest Spring Integration release, that missed to announce a 6.0 RC1 last week.
But I believe it is still worth to mention it even after Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 announcement since there is a number of notable changes and improvements.



So, please, welcome Spring Integration 6.0 first Release Candidate.
It can be obtained from Spring Milestone repository:




dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom 'org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-bom:6.0.0-RC1'
    }
}




Here you can find important changes after the previously announced Spring Integration 6.0.0-M5:





spring-integration-amqp has added support for RabbitMQ Streams;



spring-integration-sftp has been migrated from an old unsupported jsch library to more modern Apache MINA;



spring-integration-gemfire was removed according to dropped support for Apache Geode in Spring Data;



spring-integration-scripting has added a GraalVM Polyglot support for JavaScript invocations;



The Apache Groovy DSL for Spring Integration extension project has been migrated to the spring-integration-groovy module code base;



The Spring Integration for Apache Cassandra extension project has been migrated as a spring-integration-cassandra module;



The Kotlin Coroutines support has been added to the @ServiceActivator POJO functions, also messaging gateway methods can now be as suspended functions;



The AOP ChannelSecurityInterceptor in the spring-integration-security module has been deprecated in favor of AuthorizationChannelInterceptor.





Also, see a Migration Guide for breaking changes in the framework and its modules.



It would be great if you give it a chance and come back to us with reports, so it may make it into GA next month.



See you in person this December at SpringOne!



Cheers, 

Artem

Microservice-based systems have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has also regained popularity recently.
Independent of the architectural style ultimately selected, the individual applications comprising the overall system need their structure to be evolvable and able to follow changes in business requirements.



Traditionally, application frameworks have provided structural guidance by providing abstractions aligned with technical concepts, such as Spring Framework’s stereotype annotations (@Controller, @Service, @Repository, and so on).

Evolution strategy (ES) is a family of optimization techniques inspired by the ideas of natural selection: a population of candidate solutions are usually evolved over generations to better adapt to an optimization objective. ES has been applied to a variety of challenging decision making problems, such as legged locomotion, quadcopter control, and even power system control.  

Compared to gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC), ES has several advantages.

Understanding the aesthetic and technical quality of images is important for providing a better user visual experience. Image quality assessment (IQA) uses models to build a bridge between an image and a user's subjective perception of its quality. In the deep learning era, many IQA approaches, such as NIMA, have achieved success by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based IQA models are often constrained by the fixed-size input requirement in batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized or cropped to a fixed size shape. This preprocessing is problematic for IQA because images can have very different aspect ratios and resolutions…]]></summary>

What is RUM?
Elastic real user monitoring, or RUM, captures user interactions with the web browser and provides a detailed view of the “real user experience” of your web applications from a performance perspective. Elastic’s RUM Agent is a JavaScript Agent, which means it supports any JavaScript-based application. RUM can provide valuable insight into your applications.

The task of determining the similarity between images is an open problem in computer vision and is crucial for evaluating the realism of machine-generated images. Though there are a number of straightforward methods of estimating image similarity (e.g., low-level metrics that measure pixel differences, such as FSIM and SSIM), in many cases, the measured similarity differences do not match the differences perceived by a person. However, more recent work has demonstrated that intermediate representations of neural network classifiers, such as AlexNet, VGG and SqueezeNet trained on ImageNet, exhibit perceptual similarity as an emergent property.

Robot learning has been applied to a wide range of challenging real world tasks, including dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and grasping. It is less common to see robot learning applied to dynamic, high-acceleration tasks requiring tight-loop human-robot interactions, such as table tennis. There are two complementary properties of the table tennis task that make it interesting for robotic learning research. First, the task requires both speed and precision, which puts significant demands on a learning algorithm. At the same time, the problem is highly-structured (with a fixed, predictable environment) and naturally multi-agent (the robot can play with humans or another robot), makin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Monitoring is an essential facet of running applications in a production system. Through this process, organizations collect and analyze data, and determine if a program is performing as expected within set boundaries. When combined with alerting, monitoring allows for detecting unexpected system behavior to mitigate exceptional situations as fast as possible. Furthermore, tracking the performance of a system enables organizations to improve those aspects that have the biggest impact with higher priority. One essential aspect of monitoring is the list of key metrics you want to observe. There are different categories of statistics that can be of interest here. To observe the defined metrics, there are plenty of application monitoring tools on the market today. They differ in many aspects...

Building models that understand and generate natural language well is one the grand goals of machine learning (ML) research and has a direct impact on building smart systems for everyday applications. Improving the quality of language models is a key target for researchers to make progress toward such a goal.   

Most common paradigms to build and train language models use either autoregressive decoder-only architectures (e.g., PaLM or GPT-3), where the model is trained to predict the next word for a given prefix phrase, or span corruption-based encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, ST-MoE), where the training objective is to recover the subset of words masked out of the input.

Image captioning is the machine learning task of automatically generating a fluent natural language description for a given image. This task is important for improving accessibility for visually impaired users and is a core task in multimodal research encompassing both vision and language modeling.  
 
However, datasets for image captioning are primarily available in English.

Generating realistic audio requires modeling information represented at different scales. For example, just as music builds complex musical phrases from individual notes, speech combines temporally local structures, such as phonemes or syllables, into words and sentences. Creating well-structured and coherent audio sequences at all these scales is a challenge that has been addressed by coupling audio with transcriptions that can guide the generative process, be it text transcripts for speech synthesis or MIDI representations for piano. However, this approach breaks when trying to model untranscribed aspects of audio, such as speaker characteristics necessary to help people with spee…]]></summary>
