People are excellent navigators of the physical world, due in part to their remarkable ability to build cognitive maps that form the basis of spatial memory — from localizing landmarks at varying ontological levels (like a book on a shelf in the living room) to determining whether a layout permits navigation from point A to point B. Building robots that are proficient at navigation requires an interconnected understanding of (a) vision and natural language (to associate landmarks or follow instructions), and (b) spatial reasoning (to connect a map representing an environment to the true spatial distribution of objects).

I first discovered my passion for tech sales as a college graduate working in Silicon Valley. I worked at Apple as a Technical Consultant and got my start in channel sales and the network IP space at a large company that provided solutions for semiconductor and infrastructure software. Then I moved to a startup that gave me the opportunity to support Civilian agencies, the Department of Defense (DoD), and the Intelligence Community. In this role, I spent a lot of time flying between California and Washington D.C. and quickly realized that I had a great sense of fire and purpose when serving the federal government.

If the past year has taught us anything, it’s that the more things change, the more things stay the same. The whiplash and pivot from the go-go economy post-pandemic to a belt-tightening macroeconomic environment induced by higher inflation and interest rates has been seen before, but rarely this quickly. Technology leaders have always had to do more with less, but this slowdown may be unpredictable, longer, and more pronounced than expected.

Videos have become an increasingly important part of our daily lives, spanning fields such as entertainment, education, and communication. Understanding the content of videos, however, is a challenging task as videos often contain multiple events occurring at different time scales. For example, a video of a musher hitching up dogs to a dog sled before they all race away involves a long event (the dogs pulling the sled) and a short event (the dogs being hitched to the sled). One way to spur research in video understanding is via the task of dense video captioning, which consists of temporally localizing and describing all events in a minutes-long video. This differs from s…]]></summary>

As Kubernetes develops and matures, features may be deprecated, removed, or replaced
with better ones for the project's overall health. Based on the information available
at this point in the v1.27 release process, which is still ongoing and can introduce
additional changes, this article identifies and describes some of the planned changes
for the Kubernetes v1.27 release.
A note about the k8s.gcr.io redirect to registry.k8s.io
To host its container images, the Kubernetes project uses a community-owned image
registry called registry.k8s.io. On March 20th, all traffic from the out-of-date
k8s.gcr.io registry will be redirected
to registry.k8s.io. The deprecated
k8s.gcr.io registry will eventually be phased out.
What does this change mean?

These events can originate from a variety of sources, such as from an HTTP endpoint, messages on a queue or topic, or from public cloud resources. Kubernetes has become synonymous with managing infrastructure and applications in cloud native architectures and many organizations are reliant on these systems for running their business critical workloads. Automation and Kubernetes go hand in hand and Ansible already plays a role within this ecosystem.

When a patient is diagnosed with cancer, one of the most important steps is examination of the tumor under a microscope by pathologists to determine the cancer stage and to characterize the tumor. This information is central to understanding clinical prognosis (i.e., likely patient outcomes) and for determining the most appropriate treatment, such as undergoing surgery alone versus surgery plus chemotherapy. Developing machine learning (ML) tools in pathology to assist with the microscopic review represents a compelling research area with many potential applications. 

Previous studies have shown that ML can accurately identify and classify tumors in pathology images and can even predict patient prognosis using known pathology feature…]]></summary>

This is the second blog post in our chess series (don’t forget to check out the first post)! Chess is a fascinating game. What can happen on those 64 squares? 

Lichess is a platform that allows you to play chess; it publishes all rated games as archives, starting in 2013. There are a total of 4 billion games played. Yes, 4 billion matches.
Analyzing the data
We first want to look at a general overview and get an idea of the data we gathered.

First, take a look at Discover. Don’t forget to set the time picker accordingly. The histogram at the top is a nice hint to see the data distribution. We immediately noticed that Lichess had a slow start and picked up the page in early 2020. The top value of 4,095,987,675 represents all documents that fit the time picker range.

Recent years have seen tremendous advances across machine learning domains, from models that can explain jokes or answer visual questions in a variety of languages to those that can produce images based on text descriptions. Such innovations have been possible due to the increase in availability of large scale datasets along with novel advances that enable the training of models on these data. While scaling of robotics models has seen some success, it is outpaced by other domains due to a lack of datasets available on a scale comparable to large text corpora or image datasets.

In my previous article, Forensic container checkpointing in
Kubernetes, I introduced checkpointing in Kubernetes
and how it has to be setup and how it can be used. The name of the
feature is Forensic container checkpointing, but I did not go into
any details how to do the actual analysis of the checkpoint created by
Kubernetes. In this article I want to provide details how the
checkpoint can be analyzed.
Checkpointing is still an alpha feature in Kubernetes and this article
wants to provide a preview how the feature might work in the future.
Preparation
Details about how to configure Kubernetes and the underlying CRI implementation
to enable checkpointing support can be found in my Forensic container
checkpointing in Kubernetes article.

Worldwide bird populations are declining at an alarming rate, with approximately 48% of existing bird species known or suspected to be experiencing population declines. For instance, the U.S. and Canada have reported 29% fewer birds since 1970. 

Effective monitoring of bird populations is essential for the development of solutions that promote conservation. Monitoring allows researchers to better understand the severity of the problem for specific bird populations and evaluate whether existing interventions are working. To scale monitoring, bird researchers have started analyzing ecosystems remotely using bird sound recordings instead of physically in-person via passive acoustic monitoring.

Migrating to a new security information and event management (SIEM) solution can feel like a daunting task, like moving to a new house. Over the years, a lot gets accumulated and sometimes is forgotten until found in a corner. 

This blog identifies steps you can take to reduce the pain typically associated with a migration, tools that can help along the way, and questions you should ask during each phase of a migration.
Why migrate?
SIEMs are a significant investment, and once deployed, organizations typically use the same technology for many years. The solutions require a lot of time to be maintained and tuned to meet an organization’s needs, cover all necessary security use cases, ingest all required data sources, and meet any other business needs.

Despite decades of research, we don’t see many mobile robots roaming our homes, offices, and streets. Real-world robot navigation in human-centric environments remains an unsolved problem. These challenging situations require safe and efficient navigation through tight spaces, such as squeezing between coffee tables and couches, maneuvering in tight corners, doorways, untidy rooms, and more. An equally critical requirement is to navigate in a manner that complies with unwritten social norms around people, for example, yielding at blind corners or staying at a comfortable distance.

Federated learning is a distributed way of training machine learning (ML) models where data is locally processed and only focused model updates and metrics that are intended for immediate aggregation are shared with a server that orchestrates training. This allows the training of models on locally available signals without exposing raw data to servers, increasing user privacy. In 2021, we announced that we are using federated learning to train Smart Text Selection models, an Android feature that helps users select and copy text easily by predicting what text they want to select and then automatically expanding the selection for them.

Industrial applications of machine learning are commonly composed of various items that have differing data modalities or feature distributions. Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) offer a unified view of these multimodal data systems by defining multiple types of nodes (for each data type) and edges (for the relation between data items). For instance, e-commerce networks might have [user, product, review] nodes or video platforms might have [channel, user, video, comment] nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings summarizing each node’s relationships into a vector.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn skills to solve decision-making tasks like playing games, enabling robots to pick up objects, or even optimizing microchip designs. However, running RL algorithms in the real world requires expensive active data collection. Pre-training on diverse datasets has proven to enable data-efficient fine-tuning for individual downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and vision problems. In the same way that BERT or GPT-3 models provide general-purpose initialization for NLP, large RL–pre-trained models could provide general-purpose initialization for decision-making.

In no area is the magnitude of this opportunity greater than in the spheres of healthcare and medicine.  Commensurate with our mission to demonstrate these societal benefits, Google Research’s programs in applied machine learning (ML) have helped place Alphabet among the top five most impactful corporate research institutions …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Hartmut Neven, VP of Engineering, and Julian Kelly, Director of Quantum Hardware, on behalf of the Google Quantum AI Team  
Many years from today, scientists will be able to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for large-scale computations with applications across science and industry. These quantum computers will be much bigger than today, consisting of millions of coherent quantum bits, or qubits. But there’s a catch — these basic building blocks must be good enough or the systems will be overrun with errors. 

Currently, the error rates of the qubits on our 3rd generation Sycamore processor are typically between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100. Through our work and that of others, we understand that developing large-scale quantum computers will require far lower error rates. We will n…]]></summary>
