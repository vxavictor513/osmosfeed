Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor
community! In this blog post, we'll be shining a spotlight on the
Special Interest Group for Contributor
Experience
(SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project.
SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and
maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the
project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may
hinder the project's growth and feature velocity, such as pull request
latency and the number of open pull requests and issues.
SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by
creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that
facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They

Stephanie Harris has always had an interest in computers, but her initial career path started out in a different direction. 

Now, she’s a Senior Software Engineer at Elastic. 

Since she was young, Stephanie says she’s always had the ability to take confusing concepts and make them “make sense,” a skill that helped her on her winding path which eventually led her to Elastic. 

While Stephanie liked computers, she had also started teaching herself to play guitar at age thirteen. Never taking lessons, she learned through YouTube videos and a lot of practice. 

“I don’t mind struggling at something,” she says. “I was very, very bad at guitar at the beginning, and then one day I wasn’t bad anymore.”

Following her interest in music, Stephanie decided to pursue a career as a musician, so she…]]></summary>

The last few years have seen rapid progress in systems that can automatically process complex business documents and turn them into structured objects. A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows. However, the datasets used in academic literature fail to capture the challenges seen in real-world use cases. Consequently, academic b…]]></summary>

Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…]]></summary>

You may have read about our recent introduction of Elastic AI Assistant, but this isn’t just a new feature — it’s a key component  of a unified approach to security operations workflows that we call advanced entity analytics.

Advanced entity analytics combines Elastic’s highly operationalized machine learning capabilities for the detection of unusual behaviors, our entity-centric presentation of risk context to guide investigation and response, and our new generative AI sidekick. Together, these capabilities offer analysts the information they need to make fast and accurate decisions about potential threats encountered in their ecosystem.

Today, we’re excited to announce the availability of the Logstash Operator for ECK in Technical Preview. Logstash® on Kubernetes integrates with the rest of the Elastic Stack on ECK and removes the need to manage all the resources individually and manually. 

The Logstash operator allows you to manage and configure Logstash pods in just a few lines of YAML with support for configuring Logstash pipelines using the familiar Logstash Domain Specific Language (DSL) inline in the Custom Resource Definition (CRD) or in mounted volumes. Multiple pipelines and pipeline->pipeline configurations are fully supported, and any updated pipelines will be detected and reloaded inside the pod, without requiring a restart of the pod.

Elastic recently contributed the Elastic Common Schema (ECS) to the OpenTelemetry (OTel) project, enabling a unified data specification for security and observability data within the OTel Semantic Conventions framework. We are committed to developing these open standards jointly. And today, we share that several more community-minded security technology vendors are contributing to this effort. Embracing the OTel Semantic Conventions framework helps users reduce the time and effort required for querying and correlating diverse data, building visualizations, and analyzing features for machine learning applications. Normalizing security and observability data with the OTel Semantic Conventions is a powerful tool that drastically reduces the complexity that so often hinders efficient analysis of software, performance, and security issues.

Security teams and technology vendors alike are embracing open data standards to enable holistic analysis of diverse data. In fact, OTel is the second-highest velocity project in the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) because of its vendor agnostic framework.

A powerful, fast, and efficient search engine is a crucial element for any organization that relies on searching data quickly and accurately. For developers and architects, choosing the right search platform can greatly influence your organization's capacity to provide fast and relevant results. In our thorough performance testing, Elasticsearch emerges as the clear choice. Elasticsearch is 40%-140% faster than OpenSearch while using fewer compute resources.
In this article, we'll carry out a performance comparison between Elasticsearch 8.7 and OpenSearch 2.7 (the latest in both at the time of testing) across six major areas: text querying, sorting, date histogram, range, and terms and including resource utilization.

Deep learning has recently made tremendous progress in a wide range of problems and applications, but models often fail unpredictably when deployed in unseen domains or distributions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. 
 

Designing adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…]]></summary>

AI-related products and technologies are constructed and deployed in a societal context: that is, a dynamic and complex collection of social, cultural, historical, political and economic circumstances. Because societal contexts by nature are dynamic, complex, non-linear, contested, subjective, and highly qualitative, they are challenging to translate into the quantitative representations, methods, and practices that dominate standard machine learning (ML) approaches and responsible AI product development practices.   
 

The first phase of AI product development is problem understanding, and this phase has tremendous influence over how problems (…]]></summary>

In the world of Kubernetes, managing containerized applications at
scale requires powerful and efficient tools. The command-line
interface (CLI) is an integral part of any developer or operator’s
toolkit, offering a convenient and flexible way to interact with a
Kubernetes cluster.
SIG CLI plays a crucial role in improving the Kubernetes
CLI
experience by focusing on the development and enhancement of
kubectl, the primary command-line tool for Kubernetes.
In this SIG CLI Spotlight, Arpit Agrawal, SIG ContribEx-Comms team
member, talked with Katrina Verey, Tech
Lead & Chair of SIG CLI,and Maciej
Szulik, SIG CLI Batch Lead, about SIG
CLI, current projects, challenges and how anyone can get involved.

Learning from periodic data (signals that repeat, such as a heart beat or the daily temperature changes on Earth’s surface) is crucial for many real-world applications, from monitoring weather systems to detecting vital signs. For example, in the environmental remote sensing domain, periodic learning is often needed to enable nowcasting of environmental changes, such as precipitation patterns or land surface temperature. In the health domain, learning from video measurement has shown to extract (quasi-)periodic vital signs such as atrial fibrillation and sleep apnea episodes.



Approaches like RepNet highlight the importance of these types of tasks, and present a solution that recognizes rep…]]></summary>
