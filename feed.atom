The release of the Elastic Stack 8.0 introduced the ability to upload PyTorch machine learning models into Elasticsearch to provide modern natural language processing (NLP) in the Elastic Stack. NLP opens up opportunities to extract information, classify text, and provide better search relevance through dense vectors and approximate nearest neighbor search.
In this multi-part blog series, we will walk through end-to-end examples using a variety of PyTorch NLP models.
Part 1: How to deploy text embeddings and vector search
Part 2: Named entity recognition (NER)
Part 3: Sentiment analysis
In each example we will use a prebuilt NLP model from the Hugging Face model hub. Then we will follow the Elastic documented instructions for deploying an NLP model and adding NLP inference to an ingest pipeline.  Because it’s always a good idea to start with a defined use case and an understanding of the text data to process in the model, we’ll start by defining the objective for using NLP and a shared data set for anyone to try out.
To prepare for the NLP example, we will need an Elasticsearch cluster running at least version 8.0, an ML node with at least 2GB RAM, and for the named entity recognition (NER) example we’ll use the required mapper-annotated-text plugin. One of the easiest ways to get started is by following along with these NLP examples with your own free 14-day trial cluster on Elastic Cloud. Cloud trials are able to scale to a max of two 2GB ML nodes, which will allow you to deploy one or two of examples at any one time in this multi-part blog series.]]></summary>

As part of our multi-blog series on natural language processing (NLP), we will walk through an example using a sentiment analysis NLP model to evaluate if comment (text) fields contain positive or negative sentiments. Using a publicly available model, we will show you how to deploy that model to Elasticsearch and use the model in an ingest pipeline to classify customer reviews as being either a positive or negative.
Sentiment analysis is a type of binary classification where the field is predicted to be either one value or the other. There is typically a probability score for that prediction between 0 and 1, with scores closer to 1 indicating more-confident predictions. This type of NLP analysis can be usefully applied to many data sets such as product reviews or customer feedback.

An article recently published in VentureBeat details the transformation of the relationship between Elastic and AWS.

Elastic announced that the company has expanded its collaboration with AWS, and that the companies are now working together to accelerate momentum and build, market, and deliver seamless access to Elastic Cloud on AWS for our shared customers, while also leveraging AWS’s global footprint and breadth of services.

“Our expanded collaboration includes streamlined signup and onboarding, more simplified data ingestion, new go-to-market initiatives, and expanded AWS competencies and validated qualifications.”

VentureBeat reporter, Paul Sawers, spoke with Elastic CEO, Ash Kulkarni, about the collaboration between the two companies and the path forward.

Read the full article at VentureBeat to learn more about this collaboration, which Kulkarni called a “win-win” for both companies.

Today we announced an expansion to our collaboration with AWS. We’re working together to accelerate momentum and build, market and deliver seamless access to Elastic Cloud on AWS for our shared customers, while also leveraging AWS’s global footprint and breadth of services.

The following are highlights from the release:

Data binding from input arguments with validation

  
Field-level security through annotations on data @Controller methods

In recent years, natural language processing models have dramatically improved their ability to learn general-purpose representations, which has resulted in significant performance gains for a wide range of natural language generation and natural language understanding tasks. In large part, this has been accomplished through pre-training language models on extensive unlabeled text corpora.  
This pre-training formulation does not make assumptions about input signal modality, which can be language, vision, or audio, among others.

Threats knock on your door all the time. In this research piece, we explore BPFDoor — a backdoor payload specifically crafted for Linux in order to gain re-entry into a previously or actively compromised target environment. This payload has been observed across systems for five years, suggesting that the threat actors responsible for operating the malware have been around for some time and have likely operated undetected in many environments. 
The threat actors have leveraged a network of VPS servers to act as a controller and access these systems via compromised routers based out of Taiwan, acting as a VPN network for the adversarial group. In the Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team’s deep research, we explore the actual payload, the backdoor lifecycle, and the BPF filters that are leveraged to provide you with insights on how evasion occurs within impacted systems. 
It’s important to know how you can detect this payload threat and understand the sophistication of the loader. Both are covered in this research. The Elastic Security Intelligence and Analytics team also shares the actual indicators of compromise.
It’s critical to invest the time and resources into ensuring your organization’s workloads remain effectively monitored. Get started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud. Or download the self-managed version of the Elastic Stack for free.]]></summary>

The telecom industry is at an inflection point today, where the endless possibilities of 5G meet the growing challenges of accelerating 5G monetization. This is particularly true for telecom providers who have pumped billions of dollars in building 5G networks.
The telecom cloud market is expected to cross USD 74 billion by 2026. So, this presents telecom-as-a-service (TaaS) as an opportunity for telecom providers to monetize their network assets as well as decades of expertise in building and managing network infrastructure.
In this blog post, we  take a broader look into some widely acknowledged 5G monetization opportunities and explore why unified observability is a prerequisite.

When people converse with one another, context and references play a critical role in driving their conversation more efficiently. For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him. Or if someone mentions “python” in a sentence, one can use the context from the conversation to determine whether they are referring to a type of snake or a computer language. If a virtual assistant cannot robustly handle context and references, users would be required to adapt to the limitation of the technology by…]]></summary>

Economics, combinatorics, physics, and signal processing conspire to make it difficult to design, build, and operate high-quality, cost-effective wireless networks. The radio transceivers that communicate with our mobile phones, the equipment that supports them (such as power and wired networking), and the physical space they occupy are all expensive, so it’s important to be judicious in choosing sites for new transceivers. Even when the set of available sites is limited, there are exponentially many possible networks that can be built. For example, given only 50 sites, there are 250 (over a million billion) possibilities!

In recent years, scaling up the size of language models has been shown to be a reliable way to improve performance on a range of natural language processing (NLP) tasks. Today’s language models at the scale of 100B or more parameters achieve strong performance on tasks like sentiment analysis and machine translation, even with little or no training examples. Even the largest language models, however, can still struggle with certain multi-step reasoning tasks, such as math word problems and commonsense reasoning. How might we enable language models to perform such reasoning tasks?

Machine translation (MT) technology has made significant advances in recent years, as deep learning has been integrated with natural language processing (NLP). Performance on research benchmarks like WMT have soared, and translation services have improved in quality and expanded to include new languages. Nevertheless, while existing translation services cover languages spoken by the majority of people world wide, they only include around 100 languages in total, just over 1% of those actively spoken globally. Moreover, the languages that are currently represented are overwhelmingly European, largely overlooking regions of high linguistic diversity, like Africa and the Americas.

The promise of deep reinforcement learning (RL) in solving complex, high-dimensional problems autonomously has attracted much interest in areas such as robotics, game playing, and self-driving cars. However, effectively training an RL policy requires exploring a large set of robot states and actions, including many that are not safe for the robot. This is a considerable risk, for example, when training a legged robot. Because such robots are inherently unstable, there is a high likelihood of the robot falling during learning, which could cause damage. 
The risk of damage can be mitigated to some extent by learning the control policy in computer simulation and then deploying it in the real world. However, this approac…]]></summary>

Graphs are very common representations of natural systems that have connected relational components, such as social networks, traffic infrastructure, molecules, and the internet. Graph neural networks (GNNs) are powerful machine learning (ML) models for graphs that leverage their inherent connections to incorporate context into predictions about items within the graph or the graph as a whole. GNNs have been effectively used to discover new drugs, help mathematicians prove theorems, detect misinformation, and improve the accuracy of arrival time predictions in Google Maps. 
A surge of interest in GNNs during the last decade has produced thousands of GNN variants, with hundreds introduced each year. …]]></summary>

Over the last several years, the rapidly growing size of deep learning models has quickly exceeded the memory capacity of single accelerators. Earlier models like BERT (with a parameter size of < 1GB) can efficiently scale across accelerators by leveraging data parallelism in which model weights are duplicated across accelerators while only partitioning and distributing the training data. However, recent large models like GPT-3 (with a parameter size of 175GB) can only scale using model parallel training, …]]></summary>

Advances in reinforcement learning (RL) for robotics have enabled robotic agents to perform increasingly complex tasks in challenging environments. Recent results show that robots can learn to fold clothes, dexterously manipulate a rubik’s cube, sort objects by color, navigate complex environments and walk on difficult, uneven terrain. But "short-horizon" tasks such as these, which require very little long-term planning and provide immediate failure feedback, are relatively easy to train compared to many tasks that may confront a robot in a real-world setting. Unfortunately, scaling such short-horizon skills to the abstract, long horizons of real-world tasks is difficult. For example, how would one trai…]]></summary>
