Now, as of Elastic Security 7.13, we’ve introduced a new set of unsupervised machine learning jobs for network data, and accompanying alert rules, several of which look for geographic anomalies. In this blog post, we’ll explore a case study demonstrating how network data can yield important detections. 

Before the advent of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security teams relied heavily on network instrumentation like firewall logs and intrusion detection (IDS) alerts.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of the team, I’m pleased to announce the availability of the Spring Data 2021.1.0-M1 milestone release.

Both releases are built on top of Spring Framework 5.3.9. For your convenience, you can consume this release through Spring Boot 2.6.0-M1, which our team mates on the Boot team will release in about a week.

The 2021.1 release train ships a set of features and dependency upgrades.
The most important changes are:


  
Upgrade to Querydsl 5.

  
Support for a wide range of Redis 6.2 commands.

  
Support for dialect-dependent custom conversions in Spring Data JDBC. This was used to improve the support of java.time types across multiple databases.

  
Support for streaming large result sets in Spring Data JDBC.

  
Support for AggregateReference in query derivation.

We ran the State of Spring survey last year, and it was a huge success. Spring community members across the globe, like you, shared their views and experiences, and it all made for fantastic reading.

The survey is back this year, and we want to hear from you! How can Spring help you build new apps and experiences this year? What would you like us to change? This year, we have new sections on Spring Native, building & sharing APIs internally/externally, and a deeper dive on Data.

In exchange for 15 minutes of your time taking the survey, you’ll be among the first to receive our report and the insights included in it. 

Sounds good? Head over to spring.io/survey now! The survey will close at the end of July. 

Do consider helping us share the survey by retweeting this post on Spring Central twitter, and thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us!

Think about all of the data your organization generates and consumes in the digital age — from security event logs to application error messages, energy consumption to vendor contracts. There is so much, and all of it is usually stored in silos, making the data difficult to synthesize to provide better services, identify signals proactively, or make stronger business decisions. How do organizations overcome the challenges of understanding their data so that they can finally derive value from it, allowing organizations to truly put their data to work? 

The answer is to shift your organization’s thinking away from the complexity of consolidating data to how to better find the answers within it. More data can mean more insights, and those benefits h…]]></summary>
