Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn skills to solve decision-making tasks like playing games, enabling robots to pick up objects, or even optimizing microchip designs. However, running RL algorithms in the real world requires expensive active data collection. Pre-training on diverse datasets has proven to enable data-efficient fine-tuning for individual downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and vision problems. In the same way that BERT or GPT-3 models provide general-purpose initialization for NLP, large RL–pre-trained models could provide general-purpose initialization for decision-making. So, we ask the question: Can we enable similar pre-training to accele…]]></summary>

(This is Part 8 in our series of posts covering different topical areas of research at Google. You can find other posts in the series here.)
   

Google’s focus on AI stems from the conviction that this transformational technology will benefit society through its capacity to assist, complement, and empower people in almost every field and sector.  In no area is the magnitude of this opportunity greater than in the spheres of healthcare and medicine.  Commensurate with our mission to demonstrate these societal benefits, Google Research’s programs in applied machine learning (ML) have helped place Alphabet among the top five most impactful corporate research institutions …]]></summary>

Many years from today, scientists will be able to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for large-scale computations with applications across science and industry. These quantum computers will be much bigger than today, consisting of millions of coherent quantum bits, or qubits. But there’s a catch — these basic building blocks must be good enough or the systems will be overrun with errors. 

Currently, the error rates of the qubits on our 3rd generation Sycamore processor are typically between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100. Through our work and that of others, we understand that developing large-scale quantum computers will require far lower error rates. We will n…]]></summary>

After six years in the accounting department of a staffing company, Alexis Young realized she was good at her job, but it didn’t fulfill her. 
She pivoted her career path into HR in 2012 and joined Elastic as Senior HR Business Partner in 2022. Her role requires her to partner closely with her respective leadership team and the business to work through HR-related issues as they come up. 
“I’m the front-line person,” Alexis says. “It could be as simple as directing employees  to our HR shared service team and partnering on business objectives and coaching and supporting employees through various HR matters. My main focus is to help align Elastic’s people strategy with the business strategy.”

Vulnerability management (VM) is a challenging task. Of the three pillars of people, process, and technology, it is the latter that we have the most control over and that can make the greatest impact. We recognize that technology alone is not sufficient and must be accompanied by strong processes and skilled personnel. However, the right technology can greatly facilitate and improve the effectiveness of our vulnerability management efforts.

In this blog post, we will illustrate the value of the Elastic Stack as a data management platform for vulnerability management and demonstrate how we have fully automated the process of retrieving, enriching, and disseminating scan results to various teams.

Have you ever heard the saying "cooking is like science"? Well, the same could be said for machine learning. Just like cooking, building a machine learning (ML) pipeline requires a series of precise steps, a dash of creativity, and a good understanding of the ingredients you're working with.
Don't have the time, skills, or knowledge? Or are you tired of spending hours in the kitchen chopping, mixing, and blending ingredients by hand? Imagine being able to automate the entire cooking process with the push of a button. That's what you can do with an Elastic ML supervised learning job!
Just like a cooking food processor, the machine learning pipeline in Elasticsearch streamlines the process of making accurate predictions and automating decision-making. This blog post will take a closer look…]]></summary>

But the weather yesterday was pleasant. Hit songs are hits. But they’re rarely perfect. I’m a big fan of pleasant. And I often like things that are popular. Pleasant and popular are convenient, easy and riskless. The extraordinary, on the other hand, is often difficult. It can create change, challenge our perceptions and feel risky, all at once.

This is the sixth blog post in our Strava series (don’t forget to catch up on the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth)! I will take you through data onboarding, manipulation, and visualization.

What is Strava, and why is it the focus? Strava is a platform where recreational and professional athletes can share their activities. All my fitness data from my Apple Watch, Garmin, and Zwift is automatically synced and saved. Getting the data out of Strava is the first step to get an overview of my fitness.

This time we take a look at some of our newest features in the machine learning space.
AIOps
In the past few releases, we introduced many features related to machine learning. From importing custom models to out-of-the-box functions such as explain log rate spikes.

Many languages spoken worldwide cover numerous regional varieties (sometimes called dialects), such as Brazilian and European Portuguese or Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese. Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…]]></summary>

The goal of a customer success manager (CSM) is in the title — to help customers succeed.
At Elastic, CSMs are trusted advisors to our clients. They act as the bridge between the customer and Elastic to help solve problems, offer solutions, and integrate Elastic technologies into a client’s existing infrastructure.
But, these roles are relatively new. With widespread public cloud adoption, companies have changed how they look at IT spending. Instead of focusing on long-term expenses (CAPEX), they are focused on operating expenses (OPEX). They want to maximize their return on software and technology investments. Which is where CSM’s come in.
Elastic CSMs aren’t involved in the sales process — this sets us apart from CSMs at other companies. Here at Elastic, they work with the account team…]]></summary>

Since 8.0 and the release of third-party natural language processing (NLP) models for text embeddings, users of the Elastic Stack have access to a wide variety of models to embed their text documents and perform query-based information retrieval using vector search.
Given all these components and their parameters, and depending on the text corpus you want to search in, it can be overwhelming to choose which settings will give the best search relevance.
In this series of blog posts, we will introduce a number of tests we ran using various publicly available data sets and information retrieval techniques that are available in the Elastic Stack. We’ll then provide recommendations of the best techniques to use depending on the setup.

It often requires “init steps” in your infrastructure as code processes, such as creating specific application-related users, roles, data retention and backup policies, and often dealing with RESTful API calls and misconfigurations that might happen along the way.
This is why we’re excited to introduce a new type of Custom Resource (CRD) to Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) — Elastic Stack Configuration Policies. This new policy CRD allows you to explicitly configure Elasticsearch clusters managed by ECK.

Differential privacy (DP) machine learning algorithms protect user data by limiting the effect of each data point on an aggregated output with a mathematical guarantee. Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. 

However, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including "unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation. For example, suppose we want to privately estimate the average of a dataset, and we know that a sphere of dia…]]></summary>

Within our lifetimes, we will see robotic technologies that can help with everyday activities, enhancing human productivity and quality of life. Before robotics can be broadly useful in helping with practical day-to-day tasks in people-centered spaces — spaces designed for people, not machines — they need to be able to safely & competently provide assistance to people.

Anomaly detection (AD), the task of distinguishing anomalies from normal data, plays a vital role in many real-world applications, such as detecting faulty products from vision sensors in manufacturing, fraudulent behaviors in financial transactions, or network security threats. Depending on the availability of the type of data — negative (normal) vs. positive (anomalous) and the availability of their labels — the task of AD involves different challenges.

The explosion in deep learning a decade ago was catapulted in part by the convergence of new algorithms and architectures, a marked increase in data, and access to greater compute. In the last 10 years, AI and ML models have become bigger and more sophisticated — they’re deeper, more complex, with more parameters, and trained on much more data, resulting in some of the most transformative outcomes in the history of machine learning.  
 As these models increasingly find themselves deployed in production and business applications, the efficiency and costs of these models has gon…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes project runs a community-owned image registry called registry.k8s.io to host its container images. On the 3rd of April 2023, the old registry k8s.gcr.io will be frozen and no further images for Kubernetes and related subprojects will be pushed to the old registry.
This registry registry.k8s.io replaced the old one and has been generally available for several months. We have published a blog post about its benefits to the community and the Kubernetes project. This post also announced that future versions of Kubernetes will not be available in the old registry. Now that time has come.

   As global temperatures rise, wildfires around the world are becoming more frequent and more dangerous. Their effects are felt by many communities as people evacuate their homes or suffer harm even from proximity to the fire and smoke.  

As part of Google’s mission to help people access trusted information in critical moments, we use satellite imagery and machine learning (ML) to track wildfires and inform affected communities. Our wildfire tracker was recently expanded. It provides updated fire boundary information every 10–15 minutes, is more accurate than similar satellite products, and improves on our previous work.

Observability requires the right data at the right time for the right consumer

having best practices for cluster observability across all Kubernetes components is crucial.
SIG Instrumentation helps to address this issue by providing best practices and tools
that all other SIGs use to instrument Kubernetes components-like the API server,
scheduler, kubelet and kube-controller-manager.
In this SIG Instrumentation spotlight, Imran Noor Mohamed,

Language models are now capable of performing many new natural language processing (NLP) tasks by reading instructions, often that they hadn’t seen before. The ability to reason on new tasks is mostly credited to training models on a wide variety of unique instructions, known as “instruction tuning”, which was introduced by FLAN and extended in T0, Super-Natural Instructions, MetaICL, and InstructGPT.
