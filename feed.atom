Within Elastic we call ourselves Customer Zero and we strive to always use the newest versions of our products. 

In the previous blog posts we gave an overview of our architecture and what data we send to our clusters. In this blog post we will provide instructions on how we use Cross Cluster Search (CCS) with the Security and Machine Learning (ML) applications

Configuring CCS

Getting the Security app to work with CCS only requires a few minor changes. The first step is to configure the Security app so that it knows to look for the CCS index patterns instead of local index patterns. To do this open the Kibana ‘Advanced Settin…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today we’re excited to announce the latest development in our ongoing partnership with Google Cloud. Now developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and security analysts can ingest data from Google Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack with just a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console. By leveraging Google Dataflow templates, Elastic makes it easy to stream events and logs from Google Cloud services like Google Cloud Audit, VPC Flow, or firewall into the Elastic Stack. This allows customers to simplify their data pipeline architecture, eliminate operational overhead, and reduce the time required for troubleshooting.

Many developers, SREs, and security analysts who use Google Cloud to develop applications and set up their infrastructure also use the Elastic Stack to troubleshoot, monitor, and …]]></summary>
