If you’ve paid attention to the quantum computing space, you’ve heard the claim that in the future, quantum computers will solve certain problems exponentially more efficiently than classical computers can. They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.



For the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems. We want to be more concrete: Exactly which problems are quantum computers more suited to tackle than their classical counterparts, an…]]></summary>

What are the current options to migrate from OpenSearch to Elasticsearch®?
OpenSearch is a fork of Elasticsearch 7.10 that has diverged quite a bit from itself lately, resulting in a different set of features and also different performance, as this benchmark shows (hint: it’s currently much slower than Elasticsearch).
Given the differences between the two solutions, restoring a snapshot from OpenSearch is not possible, nor is reindex-from-remote, so our only option is then using something in between that will read from OpenSearch and write to Elasticsearch.
This blog will show you how easy it is to migrate from OpenSearch to Elasticsearch for better performance and less disk usage!

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
At Elastic®, we are constantly looking for new ways to simplify search experience, and we started to look at the IoT world. The collection of data coming from IoT can be quite challenging, especially when we have thousands of devices.

Elasticsearch® can be very useful to collect, explore, visualize, and discover data — for all the data coming from multiple devices. Elastic’s distributed nature enables it to easily handle requests from millions of devices.

Thanks to the collaboration with Arduino, a very popular brand in IoT, we tested some devices and we developed an experimental open source library that connects Arduino boards to Elasticsearch in a very easy way.

Remote work gives employees increased flexibility, decreased stress, and higher productivity. It’s not just good for people, remote work can also lessen our environmental impacts —  something we at Elastic can get behind. 
Elastic is distributed by design, meaning many of our Elasticians work from where they work best. This set-up allows us to operate in a more carbon efficient way, which aligns with our overall sustainability goals. Our in-office people-to-desk ratio is 3:1, so we’re able to reduce employee commuting and minimize office energy usage, water consumption, and waste generation.
But we want to go further than that and educate our employees on how they can be more energy efficient and reduce their own personal impact. We measure our greenhouse gas emissions from work-from-hom…]]></summary>

In the world of monitoring and observability, Prometheus has grown into the de-facto standard for monitoring in cloud-native environments because of its robust data collection mechanism, flexible querying capabilities, and integration with other tools for rich dashboarding and visualization. 

Prometheus is primarily built for short-term metric storage, typically retaining data in-memory or on local disk storage, with a focus on real-time monitoring and alerting rather than historical analysis. While it offers valuable insights into current metric values and trends, it may pose economic challenges and fall short of the robust functionalities and capabilities necessary for in-depth historical analysis, long-term trend detection, and forecasting. This is particularly evident in large envir…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes community recently announced
that their legacy package repositories are frozen, and now they moved to
introduced community-owned package repositories powered by the
OpenBuildService (OBS).
CRI-O has a long history of utilizing
OBS for their package builds,
but all of the packaging efforts have been done manually so far.
The CRI-O community absolutely loves Kubernetes, which means that they're
delighted to announce that:
All future CRI-O packages will be shipped as part of the officially supported
Kubernetes infrastructure hosted on pkgs.k8s.io!
There will be a deprecation phase for the existing packages, which is currently
being discussed in the CRI-O community.
The new infrastructure will only support releases of CRI-O >= v1.28.2 as well as

As most people navigate their everyday world, they process visual input from the environment using an eye-level perspective. Unlike robots and self-driving cars, people don't have any "out-of-body" sensors to help guide them. Instead, a person’s sensory input is completely "egocentric", or "from the self." This also applies to new technologies that understand the world around us from a human-like perspective, e.g., robots navigating through unknown buildings, AR glasses that highlight objects, or assistive technology to help people run independently.

Typical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. 



Using methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons. Firs…]]></summary>

A mobile phone’s camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…]]></summary>

The human brain is perhaps the most computationally complex machine in existence, consisting of networks of billions of cells. Researchers currently don’t understand the full picture of how glitches in its network machinery contribute to mental illnesses and other diseases, such as dementia. However, the emerging connectomics field, which aims to precisely map the connections between every cell in the brain, could help solve that problem. While maps have only been created for simpler organisms, technological advances for mapping even larger brains can enable us to understand how the human brain works, and how to treat brain diseases.

What a journey so far!
Starting from the initial blog post “How we made Kubernetes insanely easy to install” in September 2016, followed by an exciting growth that lead to general availability / “Production-Ready Kubernetes Cluster Creation with kubeadm” two years later.
And later on a continuous, steady and reliable flow of small improvements that is still going on as of today.
What is kubeadm? (quick refresher)
kubeadm is focused on bootstrapping Kubernetes clusters on existing infrastructure and performing an essential set of maintenance tasks. The core of the kubeadm interface is quite simple: new control plane nodes
are created by running kubeadm init and
worker nodes are joined to the control plane by running
kubeadm join.

The kubeadm tool now supports etcd learner mode, which
allows you to enhance the resilience and stability
of your Kubernetes clusters by leveraging the learner mode
feature introduced in etcd version 3.4.
This guide will walk you through using etcd learner mode with kubeadm. By default, kubeadm runs
a local etcd instance on each control plane node.
In v1.27, kubeadm introduced a new feature gate EtcdLearnerMode. With this feature gate enabled,
when joining a new control plane node, a new etcd member will be created as a learner and
promoted to a voting member only after the etcd data are fully aligned.
What are the advantages of using etcd learner mode?
etcd learner mode offers several compelling reasons to consider its adoption
in Kubernetes clusters:

Large language models (LLMs) have enabled a new data-efficient learning paradigm wherein they can be used to solve unseen new tasks via zero-shot or few-shot prompting. However, LLMs are challenging to deploy for real-world applications due to their sheer size. For instance, serving a single 175 billion LLM requires at least 350GB of GPU memory using specialized infrastructure, not to mention that today's state-of-the-art LLMs are composed of over 500 billion parameters. Such computational requirements are inaccessible for many research teams, especially for applications that require low latency performance.




To circumvent these deployment challenges, practitioners often choose to deplo…]]></summary>

In recent years, we have witnessed rising interest across consumers and researchers in integrated augmented reality (AR) experiences using real-time face feature generation and editing functions in mobile applications, including short videos, virtual reality, and gaming. As a result, there is a growing demand for lightweight, yet high-quality face generation and editing models, which are often based on generative adversarial network (GAN) techniques. However, the majority of GAN models suffer from high computational complexity and the need for a large training dataset. In addition, it is also important to employ GAN models responsibly.
