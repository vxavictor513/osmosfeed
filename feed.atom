This week was no exception. I joined the my buddy Matt Raible and Brian Demeers today for the OktaDev Twitch channel and we hacked on making the Spring Boot starter for Okta work with Spring Native. The goal is that you should be able to bring your application unchanged with Spring Native, and this is yet another example of that working. We didn’t know what issues we were going to face, but we managed to figure out the relatively minor things required to make it work within an hour and within two hours we had most a working, standalone “hints” .jar dependency that users can add to their spring-aot plugins dependencies. Hopefully they…]]></summary>

We accomplished our goal and reduced the overall time it takes users to go from a blank slate to a meaningful dashboard that conveys insights about the data. 
 In this post, I’m going to explain the technical concepts behind these improvements, and how they work to create a user-friendly and efficient dashboard creation process. My hope for this post is that it helps inform the mental models of our curious power users while they attempt to learn these new dashboard creation flows.

That’s why we built an integration that automatically maps Splunk-ingested data to Elastic Common Schema (ECS).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[TL;DR: We recommend that you use the new point-in-time functionality in Elasticsearch if you can. The scroll API is no longer recommended for deep pagination (even though it still works).
Most data is constantly changing. When querying an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially searching for data at a given point of time. With an index that is constantly changing — as in most observability and security use cases — two identical queries performed at two different times will return different results because the data has changed over time. So, what do you do if you need to remove that time variable?
The point in time (PIT) reader, which was introduced in Elasticsearch 7.10, gives you the ability to repeatedly query an index as it was at a specific point in time.

Decisions that need to be made in an instant require answers in real time, but existing big data systems are unable to return queries quickly enough for real-time analytics.

The DoD Data Strategy approaches this challenge by providing a blueprint for how data should be managed and accessed by the services, ensuring that trusted information gets to the right destinations at the right time.

Start here. Spring Native is awesome and this is the comprehensive introduction I wish I’d had at the start. 

The next time we meet in this humble column, next week, will be June 22nd, and by then we’ll have passed summer solstice - the longest day in the year! - and the beginning of summer. Farewell (for now) to Spring, the season, and long live Spring, the easiest and most productive path to production for your applications. 

Anyway, my friends, we’ve got a ton of things to look at this week, starting of course with that Spring Native video and release announcement, of course, so let’s get to it! 


  
In this week’s installment of Spring Tips, I look at Spring Native 0.10.0, available now.

Microsoft provides security vendors with the ability to register callbacks that will be invoked upon the creation of processes on the system. Driver developers can call APIs such as PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx to receive such events.

Despite the name, PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx callbacks are not actually invoked upon the creation of processes, but rather upon the creation of the first threads within those processes. This creates a gap between when a process is created and when security products are notified of its creation. It also gives malware authors a window to tamper with the backing executable before security products can scan it. R…]]></summary>

If you want a headline as to why you should consider adopting Elastic for security and observability, that is it. 

We often work with our customers to help them establish the business value of Elastic within their organizations. We commissioned Forrester to conduct a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of our security and observability solutions so our customers have an unbiased view that they can share with their internal stakeholders. The TEI examines the ROI organizations realize by deploying the Elastic Observability and Security solutions. 

This study showcases the incredible value that our customers are achieving and provides guidance to help you consider the costs, benefits, and business impact Elastic can bring to your organization.

This blog provides a high-level breakdown of the steps to enrich your Windows process event data using the released model to generate alerts when LOtL activity is detected in your environment.

Windows 8.1 introduced the concept of Protected Process Light (PPL), which enables specially-signed programs to run in such a way that they are immune from tampering and termination, even by administrative users. The goal is to keep malware from running amok — tampering with critical system processes and terminating anti-malware applications. There is a hierarchy of PPL “levels,” with higher-privilege ones immune from tampering by lower-privilege ones, but not vice-versa.

Today it’s my pleasure to announce releases of Spring Integration for Amazon Web Services extension versions 2.5.1 and Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0.



These releases can be downloaded from Maven Central:




compile 'org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-aws:2.5.1'




If you don’t use Kinesis Binder.
Or via Binder dependency:




compile 'org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis:2.2.0'




Spring Integration for AWS extension of 2.5.1 has some minor bug fixes after the previous 2.5.0 announcement.



The Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0 is the first release in the project generation which is based on a new independent Spring Cloud for AWS artifact. It also was upgraded to the latest Spring Cloud 2020.0.3 and has some other bug fixes and improvements.



Any feedback is welcome via all the available communication channels!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Creating an entity-centric index that contains only the latest document for each entity can be useful in a number of situations. For example, maybe you're managing an ecommerce site and you want to track the latest order placed by each of your customers. Or maybe you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven't been active over a certain period. What's the fastest and most efficient way to compile and organize such data?

Transforms in Elasticsearch enable you to create and maintain an entity-centric index based on the event index and a transforming function. Until recently, the only possible function was pivot, which is a continuous group-by plus aggregations. In version 7.12, we’ve added one more transforming function, called latest. It transforms a source index into a destinat…]]></summary>

 We've been happy to see the level of community support for this change.  While we would have preferred to collaborate with Amazon, we're glad that with their fork and commitment to rename the Amazon Elasticsearch Service, it means that they will no longer be the cause of confusion in the Elasticsearch and Kibana commu…]]></summary>

We need a way for a test to start a server and tell us where it is listening, and then we need to be able to register request and response examples (a.k.a. "contracts"). That’s what this project provides - it’s like Wiremock but for RSocket.



Getting Started



The easiest way to use the project is as a JUnit (Jupiter) extension, e.g:




@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(RSocketServerExtension.class)
class SocketsApplicationTests {
	...
}




With this extension installed the Spring Boot tests will run with an RSocket server listening on a port given by test.rsocket.server.port, so the test can connect directly to it, or (more likely) the code that it is testing will connect to it. …]]></summary>
