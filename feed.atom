        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Laura Downs and Anthony Francis, Software Engineers, Robotics at Google  
Many recent advances in computer vision and robotics rely on deep learning, but training deep learning models requires a wide variety of data to generalize to new scenarios. Historically, deep learning for computer vision has relied on datasets with millions of items that were gathered by web scraping, examples of which include ImageNet, Open Images, YouTube-8M, and COCO. However, the process of creating these datasets can be labor-intensive, and can still exhibit labeling errors that can distort the perception of progress. Furthermore, this strategy does not readily generalize to arbitrary three-dimensional shapes or real-world robotic data.  
 

Real-world robotic data collection is very useful, but diffi…]]></summary>

Shortly after, Christian Dupuis joined, led the project for many years and initiated the Spring Tool Suite on top of Spring IDE.

It’s been a long time since then.

I was in Toronto, Canada, for the epic SpringOne Tour installment there. I’ve also had the privilege of taking these last two trips with my daughter, Kimly. She’s on summer break from school. It’s made the long miserable hours in economy bearable, and something for which I couldn’t be more grateful. I’m also looking forward to being at the upcoming SpringOne Tour installment in New York City, later this month. Don’t miss it!

As financial institutions migrate to modern infrastructure and cloud services, bad actors have extended their skills and capabilities to achieve their missions. This is compounded by the fact that financial and payment vehicles continue to go virtual. Even the slightest breach can result in fines and reputational harm. 

Many financial institutions are successfully taking a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, according to our recent co-sponsored study with ThoughtLab. Cybersecurity Solutions for a Riskier World reports that 91% of financial services companies are either “mid-implementation” or “advanced” in maturity against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! In thi^^^ these installments, we continue our series introducing the Spring for GraphQL project. This series features Spring for GraphQL lead Rossen Stoyanchev (@rstoya05) - whose work you may know from basically everything in the wide and wonderful world of Springdom having to do with the web (HTTP, RSocket, WebSockets, GraphQL, JSF, MVC, etc) - and GraphQL Java engine founder and lead Andi Marek (@andimarek) and of course yours truly, Spring Developer Advocate Josh Long (@starbuxman). It provides an in-depth look at all things Spring for GraphQL.

This week I’m publishing two new installments. 

In this week’s first installment, episode three of a series, looks at batching requests with Spring for GraphQL’s @BatchMapping support. This mechanism in turn builds on Facebook’s DataLoader facility. 


Then, in this week’s second installment, episode four of a series, we look at how to make a change with mutations. This is one of my favorite parts about GraphQL - it’s plain, pragmatic, and - most importantly - obvious! 


This continues the series we started last week, with episodes one and two, which I recap here: 

In this first installment, we look at the basics of using the GraphQL Java engine that underpins Spring for GraphQL. 


In this second installment, we look at using the Spring for GraphQL component model by writing queries. 


I know it’s been more than a month since we last published a video, so I’m going to be releasing every episode of this series very quickly, over the next week or two. I’ve already recorded and mostly finished producing eight episodes. I’m working on producing a ninth, and that’ll be that! A complete introduction to all things Spring for GraphQL. These are of course part of the usual Spring Tips playlist on YouTube, but also part of the Learn Spring for GraphQL with Josh Long playlist. Follow that one to be notified of any new episodes!]]></summary>

Retailers are facing a more challenging cybersecurity environment than ever, according to a new study, Cybersecurity solutions for a riskier world. With physical and digital worlds colliding, greater levels of regulation, and more savvy cybercriminals, executives agree that we have entered a new era of cyber risk. 

In fact, 30% of retailers say they are not prepared for the threats ahead.

In response to these changes, the role of the retail CISO is expanding.

Sparse models stand out among the most promising approaches for the future of deep learning. Instead of every part of a model processing every input (“dense” modeling), sparse models employing conditional computation learn to route individual inputs to different “experts” in a potentially huge network. This has many benefits. First, model size can increase while keeping computational cost constant — an effective and environmentally friendlier way to scale models, which is often key to high performance. Sparsity also naturally compartmentalizes neural networks. Dense models that learn many different tasks simultaneously (multitask) or sequentially (continual learning) of…]]></summary>

For developers who’ve created their own instrumentation with the Java Agent plugin, the next phase of the process is regression testing. By performing regression testing, you can ensure that your plugin functions the way it’s supposed to after you’ve made code changes or updates. 

You’ll have your own plugin, but to illustrate regression testing in this article, I’ll use the plugin in our example repo.

The normal sequence of activity with a plugin
First, let’s understand the normal sequence of activity when the application is started with the Elastic APM (application performance monitoring) Java Agent and the plugin, using the -javaagent option on the command line (There are several ways to attach the agent. For this sequence, let’s assume the recommended -javaagent option.)

The Elastic APM (application performance monitoring) Java Agent automatically instruments many frameworks and technologies to trace and monitor the performance of applications and track errors. Developers can also add code to instrument their own applications using the OpenTelemetry API (more on that below).

But if you can’t or don’t want to add code, and the technology you want to monitor is not automatically supported, there’s another option: use the Elastic APM Java Agent Plugin API to create your own instrumentation that runs within the Java Agent.

In this article, I’ll step through a straightforward example to show you how easy it is to create your own instrumentation that will run when both the Java Agent and the targeted technology is loaded in your application. The repo holding…]]></summary>

Such systems are stepping stones towards the longstanding goal of building multimodal conversational systems that effortlessly communicate with users while perceiving environments through multimodal input streams.  
 Unlike video understanding tasks (e.g., video classification and retrieval) where the key challenge lies in processing and understanding multimodal input videos, the task of multimodal video captioning includes the additional challenge of generating grounded captions.

After Toronto, I’m off to beautiful Berlin, Germany, for the We Are Developers show. 

If you’re at either show, don’t hesitate to say hi!

Elastic Security Labs is now the official, one-stop domain for threat research from a team of 40+ industry veterans. 
Elastic has been delivering timely and detailed security threat research for years — we’ve published more than 40 research articles and tools. We want to make it easier to find and share security threat research that will lead to a more secure workplace and a more protected industry overall.
“We feel that the availability of topical and timely security threat research has been traditionally inaccessible,” said Devon Kerr, Elastic Security Research Lead. “Elastic Security Labs intends to change this disparity and put in every security practitioner's hands the needed information and tools to protect their organizations.”

In this first installment, GraphQL Java lead Andi Marek (@andimarek) and  I (@starbuxman) look at the basics of using the GraphQL Java engine that underpins Spring for GraphQL. 


In this second installment, Andi and I are joined by Spring for GraphQL lead Rossen Stoyanchev (@rstoya05) as we look at using the Spring for GraphQL component model by writing queries. 


I know it’s been more than a month since we last published a video, so I’m going to be releasing every episode of this series very quickly, over the next week or two. I’ve already recorded and mostly finished producing eight episodes. I’m working on producing a ninth, and that’ll be that! A complete introduction to all things Spring for GraphQL. These are of course part of the usual Spring Tips playlist on YouTube, but also part of the Learn Spring for GraphQL with Josh Long playlist. Follow that one to be notified of any new episodes!]]></summary>

I love being a network engineer, even though I struggled to explain to non-networking people about the utmost relevance of network administration. However, during the last two years of the COVID-19 pandemic, the world could see the relevance of having connectivity. Networks are the highways of information. Data, applications, entertainment, and factories need the network connectivity roads to make the world run. It’s interesting that even network models to estimate traffic behavior use algorithms that are similar to the ones to estimate transportation.]]></summary>

Over the last several years, there has been an increased focus on developing differential privacy (DP) machine learning (ML) algorithms. DP has been the basis of several practical deployments in industry — and has even been employed by the U.S. Census — because it enables the understanding of system and algorithm privacy guarantees. The underlying assumption of DP is that changing a single user’s contribution to an algorithm should not significantly change its output distribution.

Oftentimes, machine learning (ML) model developers begin their design using a generic backbone model that is trained at scale and with capabilities transferable to a wide range of downstream tasks. In natural language processing, a number of popular backbone models, including BERT, T5, GPT-3 (sometimes also referred to as “foundation models”), are pre-trained on web-scale data and have demonstrated generic multi-tasking capabilities through zero-shot, few-shot or transfer learning. Compared with training over-specialized individual models, pre-training backbone models for a large number of downstream tasks can amortize the training costs, allowing one to overcome resource limitations when building large s…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Spring Boot 2.0 was the first release in the 2.x line and was published on Feburary 28th 2018.
We’ve just released Spring Boot 2.7 which means that, so far, we’ve been maintaining the 2.x line for just over 4 years.
In total we’ve published 95 distinct releases over that timeframe!



The entire Spring team, and many in our community of contributors, are now preparing for the next generation of Spring.
We are planning to release Spring Boot 3.0 in November 2022.
This next major revision will be based on Spring Framework 6.0 and will require Java 17 or above.
It will also be the first version of Spring Boot that makes use of Jakarta EE 9 APIs (jakarta.*)  instead of EE 8 (javax.*).



The next six months offer an ideal opportunity to prepare your own projects for this major relea…]]></summary>

Yesterday, my partner, her mother, and I went to Formentera, Spain, a little island off of Ibiza, Spain. It was amazing. We’re now in Ibiza, Spain, which is a little island not far from Barcelona, Spain, on the mainland of Spain. It feels a bit like that Inception movie. We traveled by boat to Formentera for a little vacation inside of another little vacation (Ibiza) and inside of another little vacation (Barcelona). Tomorrow I’ll return to Barcelona for the Spring IO event. Yes, technically, this is work. But it’s an oh-so-much pleasure, too. I can’t wait!

In recent years, natural language processing models have dramatically improved their ability to learn general-purpose representations, which has resulted in significant performance gains for a wide range of natural language generation and natural language understanding tasks. In large part, this has been accomplished through pre-training language models on extensive unlabeled text corpora.  
This pre-training formulation does not make assumptions about input signal modality, which can be language, vision, or audio, among others. Several recent papers have exploited this formulation to dramatically improve image generation results through pre-quantizing images into discrete integer …]]></summary>

When people converse with one another, context and references play a critical role in driving their conversation more efficiently. For instance, if one asks the question “Who wrote Romeo and Juliet?” and, after receiving an answer, asks “Where was he born?”, it is clear that ‘he’ is referring to William Shakespeare without the need to explicitly mention him. Or if someone mentions “python” in a sentence, one can use the context from the conversation to determine whether they are referring to a type of snake or a computer language. If a virtual assistant cannot robustly handle context and references, users would be required to adapt to the limitation of the technology by…]]></summary>
