Ad technology providers widely use machine learning (ML) models to predict and present users with the most relevant ads, and to measure the effectiveness of those ads. With increasing focus on online privacy, there’s an opportunity to identify ML algorithms that have better privacy-utility trade-offs. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a popular framework for developing ML algorithms responsibly with provable privacy guarantees. It has been extensively studied in the privacy literature, deployed in industrial applications and employed by the U.S. Census. Intuitively, the DP framework enables ML models to learn population-wide properties, while protecting user-level inf…]]></summary>

Elastic Universal ProfilingTM is based on technology that came into Elastic as part of the acquisition of optimyze.cloud — a startup that had developed Prodfiler.com, the world’s first frictionless fleet-wide in-production multi-runtime profiler that was launched in August 2021.

In order to bring the vision of frictionless deployability, low performance overhead, “just run it everywhere” magic to the broader market, a number of technical innovations were necessary. In this blog post, we will discuss one of the more important ones: how to unwind stacks without frame pointers and symbols.

Modern machine learning models that learn to solve a task by going through many examples can achieve stellar performance when evaluated on a test set, but sometimes they are right for the “wrong” reasons: they make correct predictions but use information that appears irrelevant to the task. How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label. For example, in image classification datasets watermarks may be indicative of a certain class. Or it can happen that all the pictures of dogs happen to be taken outside, against green grass, so a green background become…]]></summary>

Government agencies and educational institutions across the globe are accelerating their move toward cloud, SaaS, and customer-first digital experiences. The common denominator of all these initiatives? Data. Specifically, the quality and quantity of data you have, where you store it, how you access it, and how quickly you can find what you need. Data, in other words, is one of the public sector’s most strategic assets.
Because of data’s ubiquity, it can be hard to make sense of it holistically, especially when bridging the data silos on teams, departments, and even organizations. To help you focus on the data priorities that will have the most impact on your public sector organization, consider the following five questions.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authors: Adrian Reber (Red Hat)
Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a
sandbox environment multiple times without the original container being aware
of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.
CRIU is integrated in runc, crun, CRI-O and containerd and forensic container
checkpointing as implemented in Kubernetes uses these existing CRIU
integrations.
Why is it important?

Debugging software in production is one of the biggest challenges we have to
face in our containerized environments. Being able to understand the impact of
the available security options, especially when it comes to configuring our
deployments, is one of the key aspects to make the default security in
Kubernetes stronger. We have all those logging, tracing and metrics data already
at hand, but how do we assemble the information they provide into something
human readable and actionable?
Seccomp is one of the standard mechanisms to protect a Linux based
Kubernetes application from malicious actions by interfering with its system
calls. This allows us to restrict the application to a defined set of
actionable items, like modifying files or responding to HTTP requests. …]]></summary>

A grand vision in robot learning, going back to the SHRDLU experiments in the late 1960s, is that of helpful robots that inhabit human spaces and follow a wide variety of natural language commands. Over the last few years, there have been significant advances in the application of machine learning (ML) for instruction following, both in simulation and in real world systems. Recent Palm-SayCan work has produced robots that leverage language models to plan long-horizon behaviors and reason about abstract goals. Code as Policies has shown that code-generating language models combined with pre-trained perception systems can produce language conditioned policies for zero shot robot manipulation…]]></summary>

When speaking about observability in the cloud native space, then probably
everyone will mention OpenTelemetry (OTEL) at some point in the
conversation. That's great, because the community needs standards to rely on
for developing all cluster components into the same direction. OpenTelemetry
enables us to combine logs, metrics, traces and other contextual information
(called baggage) into a single resource. Cluster administrators or software
engineers can use this resource to get a viewport about what is going on in the
cluster over a defined period of time. But how can Kubernetes itself make use of
this technology stack?
Kubernetes consists of multiple components where some are independent and others
are stacked together. Looking at the architecture from a containe…]]></summary>

Wormholes — wrinkles in the fabric of spacetime that connect two disparate locations — may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But whether or not they exist in reality, studying these hypothetical objects could be the key to making concrete the tantalizing link between information and matter that has bedeviled physicists for decades.  
  
Surprisingly, a quantum computer is an ideal platform to investigate this connection. The trick is to use a correspondence called AdS/CFT, which establishes an equivalence between a theory that describes gravity and spacetime (and wormholes) in a fictional world with a special geometry (AdS) to a quantum theory that does not contain gravity at all …]]></summary>

I also did an in-depth look at the new GraalVM support powered by Spring’s ahead-of-time (AOT) engine.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Spring community,



On behalf of the team, it is my very great pleasure to announce that Spring Integration 6.0.0 is now generally available and can be found in Maven Central.



This release is the culmination of more than a year of work.
A massive thank you to everyone that has contributed, and to all the early adopters that have been providing vital feedback on the milestones.



This version is fully based on Spring Framework 6.0, Spring Data 2022.0, Spring for GraphQL 1.1, Spring WebServices 4.0 and many other major releases of Spring portfolio projects which contribute to their respective integration modules.
On the other hand Spring Integration 6.0 is a part of recently released Spring Boot 3.0.



Highlights of the new release include:





A Java 17 baseline



Support for native images with GraalVM and Spring AOT engine



Observability instrumentation with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing



Support for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline





There’s far too many features to list them all here in detail, so head over to the What’s New documentation page and check out a Migration Guide on GitHub.
If you just want to get started, you can easily bootstrap a new project on start.spring.io.
If you’d like to try out the GraalVM support, start.spring.io can help with that too.



Cheers, 

Artem

In recent years, language models (LMs) have become more prominent in natural language processing (NLP) research and are also becoming increasingly impactful in practice. Scaling up LMs has been shown to improve performance across a range of NLP tasks. For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale. However, one of the challenges of continued scaling is that training new, larger models requires great amounts of computational resources.

This is the first blog post in a series of ones to follow. I will take you through a journey of data onboarding, manipulation, and visualization.

What is Strava and why is it the focus? Strava is a platform where athletes, from recreational to professional, can share their activities. All my fitness data from my Apple Watch, Garmin, and Zwift is automatically synced and saved there. It is safe to say that if I want to get an overview of my fitness, getting the data out of Strava is the first step.

Why do this with the Elastic Stack? I want to ask my data questions, and questions are just searches!

Starting with Kubernetes 1.25, our container image registry has changed from k8s.gcr.io to registry.k8s.io. This new registry spreads the load across multiple Cloud Providers & Regions, functioning as a sort of content delivery network (CDN) for Kubernetes container images. This change reduces the project’s reliance on a single entity and provides a faster download experience for a large number of users.
TL;DR: What you need to know about this change
Container images for Kubernetes releases from 1.25 onward are no longer published to k8s.gcr.io, only to registry.k8s.io.
In the upcoming December patch releases, the new registry domain default will be backported to all branches still in support (1.22, 1.23, 1.24).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of the team, it is my very great pleasure to announce that Spring Boot 3.0 is now generally available and 3.0.0 can be found in Maven Central.

This release is the culmination of 12 months work and over 5700 commits by 151 different individuals. A massive thank you to everyone that has contributed, and to all the early adopters that have been providing vital feedback on the milestones.

This is the first major revision of Spring Boot since 2.0 was released 4.5 years ago. It’s also the first GA version of Spring Boot that provides support for Spring Framework 6.0 and GraalVM. 

Highlights of the new release include:


  
A Java 17 baseline

  
Support for generating native images with GraalVM, superseding the experimental Spring Native project

  
Improved observability with Micrometer and Micrometer Tracing

  
Support for Jakarta EE 10 with an EE 9 baseline


There’s far too many features to list them all here in detail, so head over to the release notes page on our wiki to find out more. If you just want to get started, you can easily bootstrap a new project on start.spring.io. If you’d like to try out the GraalVM support, start.spring.io can help with that too.

Over the coming weeks we’ll be publishing blog posts that cover some Spring Boot 3.0 features in detail.

Thanks again to everyone that has contributed to Spring and Spring Boot over the years! Supporting Jakarta EE 9 and 10, the observability enhancements, and GraalVM support has been a huge team effort that has left no corner of the Spring portfolio untouched. A special thank you to the developers of the other projects in the Spring portfolio, without whom this release would not have been possible.

End of life

It’s just over a year since the release of Spring Boot 2.6.0 which means that, as per our open source support policy, 2.6.14 is the last release that’s planned in the 2.6.x line. Releases may be made in the future, but only in response to a commercial support request.

As previously announced, Spring Boot 2.7 will be the last minor in the 2.x line. As such, we’ve extended our open source support for 2.7.x release by an additional 6 months until November 2023. In addition, commercial support for Spring Boot 2.7 has also been extended and is available until February 2025.

This video is a detailed masterclass on the new AOT engine. It starts by examining the everyday usecases of an application developer and delves deeper and deeper into the engine, treating concerns that library and framework developers will care about.

The transition to distributed applications is in full swing, driven mainly by our need to be “always-on” as consumers and fast-paced businesses. That need is driving deployments to have more complex requirements along with the ability to be globally diverse and rapidly innovate.



Cloud is becoming the de facto deployment option for today’s applications. Many cloud deployments choose to host their applications on AWS for the globally diverse set of regions it covers and the myriad of services (for faster development and innovation) available, as well as to drive operational and capital costs down. On AWS, development teams are finding additional value in migrating to Kubernetes on Amazon EKS, testing out the latest serverless options, and improving traditional, tiered applications with …]]></summary>

The Elastic Platform has long been well-regarded as an analytical system for search use cases and machine-generated data. Analytics are focused on processing data-as-ingested, where significant thought is put into how to optimally structure data as it is indexed in Elasticsearch. Kibana exposes Elasticsearch aggregations and uses them to create interactive dashboards, visualizations, and alerts.

But as the Elastic Platform is more widely adopted as a search, security, observability, and general analytics platform, analyst users require the ability to take data-as-ingested, transform it to fit their investigative needs post-ingestion, and derive insights from underlying Elasticsearch index data.

You get one shot to keep shoppers on your ecommerce website with relevant search results. According to Harris Poll, 76% of online shoppers abandon a retail website after an unsuccessful search.


Therefore, it’s critical to optimize your search experience so buyers can find what they need fast. That’s the theory behind a modern search experience: Nowadays it’s not enough to simply provide a search bar that returns matching products. Your ecommerce site must include a complete set of search tools that personally guide users to the products they want.

In this blog, you’ll learn how to start improving ecommerce search by adding two common features: scoped suggestions and query corrections, also known as “Did you mean?”

As machine learning (ML) research moves toward large-scale models capable of numerous downstream tasks, a shared understanding of a dataset’s origin, development, intent, and evolution becomes increasingly important for the responsible and informed development of ML models. However, knowledge about datasets, including use and implementations, is often distributed across teams, individuals, and even time.

The capacity of a neural network to absorb information is limited by the number of its parameters, and as a consequence, finding more effective ways to increase model parameters has become a trend in deep learning research. Mixture-of-experts (MoE), a type of conditional computation where parts of the network are activated on a per-example basis, has been proposed as a way of dramatically increasing model capacity without a proportional increase in computation. In sparsely-activated variants of MoE models (e.g., Switch Transformer, GLaM, V-MoE), a subset of experts is selected on a per-token or per-example basis, thus creating sparsity in the network. Such models have demonstrated better scaling in multiple domains and…]]></summary>

The field of natural language processing (NLP) has been revolutionized by language models trained on large amounts of text data. Scaling up the size of language models often leads to improved performance and sample efficiency on a range of downstream NLP tasks. In many cases, the performance of a large language model can be predicted by extrapolating the performance trend of smaller models. For instance, the effect of scale on language model perplexity has been empirically shown to span more than seven orders of magnitude. 

On the other hand, performance for certain other tasks does not improve in a predictable fashion. For example, the GPT-3 paper showed that the ability of language models to perform mult…]]></summary>

Mapping the wiring and firing activity of the human brain is fundamental to deciphering how we think — how we sense the world, learn, decide, remember, and create — as well as what issues can arise in brain disease or dysfunction. Recent efforts have delivered publicly available brain maps (high-resolution 3D mapping of brain cells and their connectivities) at unprecedented quality and scale, such as H01, a 1.4 petabyte nanometer-scale digital reconstruction of a sample of human brain tissue from Harvard / Google, and the cubic millimeter mouse cortex dataset from our colleagues at the MICrONS consortium. 
 
To interpret brain maps at this scale requires multiple layers of analysis,…]]></summary>

Recent advances have expanded the applicability of language models (LM) to downstream tasks. On one hand, existing language models that are properly prompted, via chain-of-thought, demonstrate emergent capabilities that carry out self-conditioned reasoning traces to derive answers from questions, excelling at various arithmetic, commonsense, and symbolic reasoning tasks. However, with chain-of-thought prompting, a model is not grounded in the external world and uses its own internal representations to generate reasoning traces, limiting its ability to reactively explore and reason or update its knowledge. On the other hand, recent work uses pre-trained language models for plannin…]]></summary>
