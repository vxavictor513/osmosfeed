Perhaps you have ingested custom data using default settings and would like to know where your data modeling efforts could make the largest impact? In this blog post we will look at how to use Elastic’s recently introduced disk usage API to answer such questions. 
Here at Elastic, when we work with our customers, one of the most common areas of improvement is index mapping configuration. A lack of mappings, or using the wrong types, can increase storage usage in your Elastic deployment. This post will help you understand what fields are most influential in driving your storage footprint and how you can optimize consumption through best-practice configuration.

Whether that competition takes the form of a threat actor lurking on a network or a rival company taking new products to market, collaboration can help security and DevOps teams better protect their organizations and develop innovative technology solutions.
For instance, imagine if a security team investigating the recent Log4Shell vulnerability had access to observability data.

People interact with the world through multiple sensory streams (e.g., we see objects, hear sounds, read words, feel textures and taste flavors), combining information and forming associations between senses. As real-world data consists of various signals that co-occur, such as video frames and audio tracks, web images and their captions and instructional videos and speech transcripts, it is natural to apply a similar logic when building and designing multimodal machine learning (ML) models.  
 Effective multimodal models have wide applications — such as multilingual image retrieval, future action prediction, and vision-language navigation — and are important for several reasons; robustness, which …]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
In recent days, several security vendors have published blogs about the Linux-based exploitation (CVE-2022-0847), also known as Dirty Pipe. The Elastic Security Research team is sharing the first detailed research to help organizations find and alert on the exploitation with Elastic Security products. 

We are releasing this research so that users can defend themselves, since very little information has been shared on the actual detection of exploitation attempts. We will post more to this blog as new findings are identified in the community. 
What is Dirty Pipe? 
CVE-2022-0847 is a Linux local privilege escalation vulnerability, discovered by security researcher Max Kellermann, that takes advantage of the way the Linux kernel manages page files and named pipes allowing for the overwriting of data in read-only files.
How does it work?
The vulnerability can be exploited due to a flaw in the new pipe buffer structure where a flag member lacked proper initialization and could then contain a stale value. This could then be used to write to pages within the page cache behind read-only files, allowing for privilege escalation. Given the specific nature of this vulnerability, detection can be quite difficult.

Elastic’s research on Dirty Pipe demonstrates how the vulnerability can be detected via Auditd, what countermeasures can be used once detected, and how to respond to this exploit using Elastic Security. 

If you haven’t checked out the Elastic Security solution, take a look at our Quick Start guides (bite-sized training videos to get you started quickly) or our free fundamentals training courses. 

You can always get started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud. Or download the self-managed version of the Elastic Stack for free.]]></summary>

Machine learning (ML) detections are a powerful tool for detecting emerging threats when we don’t yet know what we’re looking for. The power of anomaly detection is the ability to detect and provide early warning on new threat activity for which rules, indicators, or signatures are not yet available. 
Using ML-based anomaly detection, such as the unsupervised ML jobs in the Elastic stack, we can shrink the dwell time for this malware persistence mechanism from 46 days to less than an hour, a decrease by a factor of 1100! 
In most cases, if the ML models were already running when this sample was executed, an anomaly would have surfaced in as little as 16 minutes.
Let’s look at a recent example.

Flexibility is more than just a buzzword. It’s now as much of a necessity for companies as it is for the people they employ. And while many companies have been trying to find ways to pivot policies to become more accommodating of the shift to remote work, here at Elastic, being flexible and distributed has been part of our source code from the start. 
For Ankitaa Bhowmick, a Solutions Architect in Elastic’s EMEA region, that flexibility means more time for family. 
We asked her about why she works for Elastic in this month’s employee spotlight.

As citizens, we interact with the government at various points in our lives. Many interactions serve as important rites of passage like obtaining a marriage or business license, claiming a new dependent on a tax return, or filing for retirement benefits. Other interactions serve as a safety net like obtaining financial assistance after a disaster or reporting a scam attempt. No matter the reason for transacting with the government, citizens want the interaction to be as frictionless as possible.
Deloitte characterizes frictionless as a way of accessing a service with little to no effort on the part of the consumer – there are no hoops to jump through, no demands for information, no frustrating barriers.

Airlines around the world are exploring several tactics to meet aggressive CO2 commitments set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). This effort has been emphasized in Europe, where aviation accounts for 13.9% of the transportation industry’s carbon emissions. The largest push comes from the European Green Deal, which aims to decrease carbon emissions from transportation by 90% by 2051. The Lufthansa Group has gone even further, committing to a 50% reduction in emissions compared to 2019 by the year 2030 and to reach net-zero emissions by 2050.  
 One unexpected approach that airlines can use to lower carbon emissions is through optimizing their tail assignment, i.e., how to assign air…]]></summary>

Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) are powerful tools for leveraging graph-structured data in machine learning. Graphs are flexible data structures that can model many different kinds of relationships and have been used in diverse applications like traffic prediction, rumor and fake news detection, modeling disease spread, and understanding why molecules smell. 
 

Graphs can model the relationships between many different types of data, including web pages (left), social connections (center), or molecules (right).

Video recognition is a core task in computer vision with applications from video content analysis to action recognition. However, training models for video recognition often requires untrimmed videos to be manually annotated, which can be prohibitively time consuming. In order to reduce the effort of collecting videos with annotations, learning visual knowledge from videos with weak labels, i.e., where the annotation is auto-generated without manual intervention, has attracted growing research interest, thanks to the large volume of easily accessible video data. Untrimmed videos, for example, are often acquired by querying with keywords for classes that the video recognition model aims to classify.…]]></summary>

In recent years, we have seen dramatic improvements on lexical tasks such as automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, machine systems still struggle to understand paralinguistic aspects — such as tone, emotion, whether a speaker is wearing a mask, etc. Understanding these aspects represents one of the remaining difficult problems in machine hearing. In addition, state-of-the-art results often come from ultra-large models trained on private data, making them impractical to run on mobile devices or to release publicly.

Proteins are essential molecules found in all living things. They play a central role in our bodies’ structure and function, and they are also featured in many products that we encounter every day, from medications to household items like laundry detergent. Each protein is a chain of amino acid building blocks, and just as an image may include multiple objects, like a dog and a cat, a protein may also have multiple components, which are called protein domains. Understanding the relationship between a protein’s amino acid sequence — for example, its domains — and its structure or function are long-standing challenges with far-reaching scientific implications.

Action recognition has become a major focus area for the research community because many applications can benefit from improved modeling, such as video retrieval, video captioning, video question-answering, etc. Transformer-based approaches have recently demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on several benchmarks. While Transformer models require data to learn better visual priors compared to ConvNets, action recognition datasets are relatively small in scale. Large Transformer models are typically first trained on image datasets and later fine-tuned on a target action recognition dataset.

In 2017, Google introduced federated learning (FL), an approach that enables mobile devices to collaboratively train machine learning (ML) models while keeping the raw training data on each user's device, decoupling the ability to do ML from the need to store the data in the cloud. Since its introduction, Google has continued to actively engage in FL research and deployed FL to power many features in Gboard, including next word prediction, emoji suggestion and out-of-vocabulary word discovery. Federated learning is improving the “Hey Google” detection models in Assistant, suggesting replies in Google Messages, predicting text selections, and more. 
While FL allows ML without raw data collection, differe…]]></summary>

Over the past several years, deep neural networks (DNNs) have been quite successful in driving impressive performance gains in several real-world applications, from image recognition to genomics. However, modern DNNs often have far more trainable model parameters than the number of training examples and the resulting overparameterized networks can easily overfit to noisy or corrupted labels (i.e., examples that are assigned a wrong class label). As a consequence, training with noisy labels often leads to degradation in accuracy of the trained model on clean test data. Unfortunately, noisy labels can appear in several real-world scenarios due to multiple factors, such as errors and inconsistencies in …]]></summary>

While not immediately obvious, all of us experience the world in four dimensions (4D). For example, when walking or driving down the street we observe a stream of visual inputs, snapshots of the 3D world, which, when taken together in time, creates a 4D visual input. Today’s autonomous vehicles and robots are able to capture much of this information through various onboard sensing mechanisms, such as LiDAR and cameras. 
 LiDAR is a ubiquitous sensor that uses light pulses to reliably measure the 3D coordinates of objects in a scene, however, it is also sparse and has a limited range — the farther one is from a sensor, the fewer points will be returned. This means that far-away objects might only get a hand…]]></summary>

In the world of networks, there are models that can explain observations across a diverse collection of applications. These include simple tasks such as computing the shortest path, which has obvious applications to routing networks but also applies in biology, e.g., where the slime mold Physarum is able to find shortest paths in mazes. Another example is Braess’s paradox — the observation that adding resources to a network can have an effect opposite to the one expected — which manifests not only in road networks but also in mechanical and electrical systems. For instance, constructing a new road can increase traffic congestion or adding a new link in an electrical circuit can increase voltage. Such connec…]]></summary>

  Mechanical ventilators provide critical support for patients who have difficulty breathing or are unable to breathe on their own. They see frequent use in scenarios ranging from routine anesthesia, to neonatal intensive care and life support during the COVID-19 pandemic. A typical ventilator consists of a compressed air source, valves to control the flow of air into and out of the lungs, and a "respiratory circuit" that connects the ventilator to the patient. In some cases, a sedated patient may be connected to the ventilator via a tube inserted through the trachea to their lungs, a process called invasive ventilation.

Machine learning (ML) has become prominent in information technology, which has led some to raise concerns about the associated rise in the costs of computation, primarily the carbon footprint, i.e., total greenhouse gas emissions. While these assertions rightfully elevated the discussion around carbon emissions in ML, they also highlight the need for accurate data to assess true carbon footprint, which can help identify strategies to mitigate carbon emission in ML.
 
In “The Carbon Footprint of Machine Learning Training Will Plateau, Then Shrink”, accepted for publication in IEEE Computer, we focus on operational carbon emissions — i.e., the energy cost of operating ML hardware, including data center overhead…]]></summary>
