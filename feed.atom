Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost increase…]]></summary>

While nearly one in five companies say they are releasing code 10 times faster than in the past, more software means more security flaws, and greater opportunity for bad actors to take advantage of them. 
The faster pace and increasing risks highlight the need for IT leaders to get serious about embracing DevSecOps, a management approach that makes security a shared responsibility among development, security, and IT operations teams. One indication that DevSecOps is gaining traction in the enterprise: Nearly half of development teams used application security tools in 2020, compared to just under 30% in 2015, according to 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The rise of “Open Banking” has enabled banking customers to choose to share their previously inaccessible, locked down data with all sorts of third parties — from budgeting apps to mobile wallets, to peer to peer payment providers. This revolution has been a welcome boon for banks, customers, and financial services innovators alike. The ability to securely share access and permissions to accounts has fueled the rise and growth of an entire new industry — FinTech —  as retail and institutional customers finally have the power of choice. The result has been the creation of an ever-growing ecosystem of new players constructing applications, modernizing infrastructure, and accelerating the pace of change.

You might now ask why is there a new release in the calver 2021.x version and why is there already a 2022.x release?

In parallel to working on Spring Data 3.x, aka 2022.0.0, we continue to invest in the support of the Spring Data 2.x development line. We already expect Spring Data 2.7 and 2.8 releases. So, if you want to continue using Spring Boot 2 for an extended period of time, stick to the 2021.x release trains (which are based on Spring Framework 5.3 and Java 8).

The early stages of an intrusion usually include initial access, execution, persistence, and command-and-control (C2) beaconing. When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected. It can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary as we saw in the 2020 SUNBURST supply chain compromise. Could we then have detected SUNBURST in the initial hours or days by finding its C2 beacon?
The potential for beaconing detection is that it can serve as an early warning system and help discover novel persistence mechanisms in the initial hours or days after execution. This allows defenders to disrupt or evict the threat actor before they can achieve their objectives. So, while we are not quite "left of boom" b…]]></summary>

Today we had an exciting announcement at Elastic. Below is part of an internal email that we shared with our fellow Elasticians. 
First, hear from Shay:
Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Israel because it was better for my family (that took time to happen, Covid!). At that time, I started thinking about how to do what is right for my family while being able to be a meaningful part of Elastic. Those of you who know me, know that Elastic is my life’s work. And we have only just begun. Our potential is massive. And I plan to be a part of it for a very, very long time. 
At around that time, the Elastic Board and I brought in several new leaders. We had time to closely observe our leaders in action. We want to make sure we have the right team, in the right roles - to realize our pote…]]></summary>

We are thrilled to announce the first release candidate of 8.0.0 after the last beta release. Again, we want to remind you that this is not for production use. There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-rc1 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).
We’d love to get your feedback and tips on any bugs you find through our Pioneer Program. To become an Elastic Pioneer, try out the preview of any (preferably, every) part of the Elastic Stack and open issues as you find them in the appropriate repo — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and APM. When you open an issue, mention that you found the bug in 8.0.0-rc1, and we’ll add a “Pioneer Program” label.
If you have questions about preparing for your upgrade to 8.0, visit our forums or community Slack channel, and we’d be happy to help!

Try it out
And now, without further ado, we bring to you 8.0.0-rc1. Happy downloading. Go forth, and explore.

Over the last several decades, I've witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we'll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I’ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we’ll likely see in the next few years.

This week also marks the 11th anniversary of This Week in Spring, which I started writing on the first Tuesday of January 2011 thanks to a great idea from SpringSource co-founder and all-around good-guy Keith Donald (@kdonald). 

What a run! As always, I just wanna extend a heartfelt thanks to all of you who read (_suffer!_) my rambling writing every week. We’ve been lucky, as a community, to have presided over the most amazing and uplifting period in Spring and the JVM’s history… This roundup has reflected that with incredible stuff happening all the time. Where there’s smoke, there’s fire. The many blogs, articles, podcasts, YouTube (and ever so occasionally Vimeo) videos…]]></summary>

This last year’s been insanely busy, and one of the things I’ve most loved is all the opportunities to use Spring Native to build GraalVM-powered architecture-specific native images.

We released Spring Native 0.11, which is fantastic because it features a brand new AOT (ahead-of-time) engine that completely reworks how we transpile Spring Boot applications into GraalVM native images. I’ve been working with GraalVM a lot over the last two years, and this new release is a vast, revolutionary step in the story of Spring Native and a giant leap forward on the journey to Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land in 2022.

Federated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  
 However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[A financial customer explained his first automation priority in the most visual and understandable way: “I want to paint all of my network devices with the color of the company.” What I like about that analogy is that it clearly describes the first rule for automation: customers must define their golden configurations (the color to paint) to be able to automate configurations and later assess compliance, and remediate any issues accordingly. 
A “golden configuration” usually refers to a Day 1 configuration, and covers the minimal settings needed for a network device to be configured after a fresh network operating system installation. This usually includes common services such as NTP, DNS, AAA, Syslog, SNMP, and ACLs for management connectivity.]]></summary>
