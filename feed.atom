The Kubernetes in-tree storage plugin to Container Storage Interface (CSI) migration infrastructure has already been beta since v1.17. CSI migration was introduced as alpha in Kubernetes v1.14.
Since then, SIG Storage and other Kubernetes special interest groups are working to ensure feature stability and compatibility in preparation for CSI Migration feature to go GA.
SIG Storage is excited to announce that the core CSI Migration feature is generally available in Kubernetes v1.25 release!
SIG Storage wrote a blog post in v1.23 for CSI Migration status update which discussed the CSI migration status for each storage driver. It has been a while and this article is intended to give a latest status update on each storage driver for their CSI Migration status in Ku…]]></summary>

According to a 2021 report from Postman, developers reported spending nearly half of their time working on APIs, and 94% of companies planned to increase their investments in APIs in 2022. API-first development is also gaining traction, with an impressive 67% of companies embracing this methodology. Companies like Twilio and Stripe emerged as early winners in this new economy, with the promise of many more to come.  APIs offer organizations an opportunity to tap into best-of-breed software components without having to spend precious time or development resources creating them from scratch. With that said, an often-overlooked aspect of the API economy is how...

Today’s distributed IT systems need to bring order to chaos. CIOs are tasked with managing seemingly endless amounts of data, but they can’t unlock insights without a system that breaks down silos to provide a unified view.

One solution many CIOs are considering, according to a recent study by Forrester Consulting commissioned by Elastic, is to deploy a consolidated platform based on search-powered technology that can analyze log data to simplify and optimize IT environments.

This creates a powerful one-two punch for IT teams: an observability and APM solution, combined with a security solution, both running on the same unified, search-powered technology platform.

While many IT leaders in highly-regulated sectors have opted for a slow pace of public cloud adoption, organizations that are more advanced on their journey are reaping the rewards.



McKinsey found through a series of surveys that large companies put up to 15% of their applications in the cloud, but continue to host the core of their technology environment in traditional data centers. The data shows that a lift-and-shift model of select applications offers limited payback. But, payback increases as organizations shift to a broader PaaS model. And, another study from Wipro showed that the speedy adoption of cloud by retail and CPG sectors have actually driven revenue gains.

In Kubernetes 1.25, Validation rules for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) have graduated to Beta!
Validation rules make it possible to declare how custom resources are validated using the Common Expression Language (CEL). For example:

kind: CustomResourceDefinition

 openAPIV3Schema:
 type: object

Many exciting contemporary applications of computer science and machine learning (ML) manipulate multidimensional datasets that span a single large coordinate system, for example, weather modeling from atmospheric measurements over a spatial grid or medical imaging predictions from multi-channel image intensity values in a 2d or 3d scan. In these settings, even a single dataset may require terabytes or petabytes of data storage. Such datasets are also challenging to work with as users may read and write data at irregular intervals and varying scales, and are often interested in performing analyses using numerous machines working in parallel.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[FEEL (Friendly Enough Expression Language) was created by the Object Management Group (OMG) “as part of the DMN standard”. Its goal is to be easy to understand, and at the same time, be full-featured enough to handle decision tables and literal expressions. When business and IT often work together on complex projects, writing expressions in a (relatively) accessible way reduces miscommunications and helps align teams. Camunda uses FEEL to map and transform business process data dynamically. For example, a loan application process pulls a credit score from an API call into a decision table. The decision table automates the next step of the process depending on the rules in the table. The data from the decision automation can then be...

A long-standing problem in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, view synthesis is the task of creating new views of a scene from multiple pictures of that scene. This has received increased attention [1, 2, 3] since the introduction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The problem is challenging because to accurately synthesize new views of a scene, a model needs to capture many types of information — its detailed 3D structure, materials, and illumination —  from a small set of reference images.  
In this post, we present recently published deep learning models for view synthesis. In “Light Field Neural Rendering” (LFNR), presented at CVPR 2022, we address the challenge of accurately repro…]]></summary>

In this article, we will cover how Elastic Observability can be leveraged to provide the data insights needed to prepare for and react to the holiday rush of traffic that will be hitting ecommerce infrastructure around the globe in just two short months. If this is the first time you’re reading about Elastic Observability, my colleague Paul Smalera, wrote a fantastic article that provides a complete overview of the solution.

Kubernetes v1.25, released earlier this month, introduced a new feature
that lets your cluster expand storage volumes, even when access to those
volumes requires a secret (for example: a credential for accessing a SAN fabric)
to perform node expand operation. This new behavior is in alpha and you
must enable a feature gate (CSINodeExpandSecret) to make use of it.
You must also be using CSI
storage; this change isn't relevant to storage drivers that are built in to Kubernetes.
To turn on this new, alpha feature, you enable the CSINodeExpandSecret feature
gate for the kube-apiserver and kubelet, which turns on a mechanism to send secretRef
configuration as part of NodeExpansion by the CSI drivers thus make use of
the same to perfor…]]></summary>

Natural language enables flexible descriptive queries about images. The interaction between text queries and images grounds linguistic meaning in the visual world, facilitating a better understanding of object relationships, human intentions towards objects, and interactions with the environment. The research community has studied object-level visual grounding through a range of tasks, including referring expression comprehension, text-based localization, and more broadly object detection, each of which require different skills in a model. For example, object detection seeks to find all objects from a predefined set of classes, which requires accurate localization and classification, while referr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.

Spring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.

Given that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.

This first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.

In the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.

Alexis Roberson, Developer Advocate at Elastic, started her career in technology because of a challenge from a college professor. The ask? To major in computer science for a semester and see how she liked it. 
Fast forward to 2019 and Alexis graduated with a computer science degree and started her career as a DevOps engineer—a far cry from the English major she thought she’d graduate with.
Now it’s probably safe to say that her professor’s instincts were right. Alexis completed multiple tech internships across the United States during college, was a teaching assistant at GirlsWhoCode, as well as hosting a sponsored six-week coding camp for middle school girls.
All of this eventually led her to becoming a developer advocate on Elastic’s community team. But first, she took a 12-week produc…]]></summary>

Retailers that weathered the global pandemic now face new challenges: emerging shopping patterns, competitive upstarts, and economic uncertainty.   
Trends that have impacted online retailers 
While ecommerce sales are expected to top $1 trillion in the U.S. for the first time ever in 2022, it is still tracking lower than 2020 levels, with a nearly 10% drop.

Pinned queries were first released in Elasticsearch 7.4 and are used to promote a chosen document, or documents, above any other documents that are at the top of the results for a certain query. It can be used for document promotion or guided searches where some documents must appear in the top results even when the relevancy score is low.

Local ephemeral storage capacity isolation was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.7 and it went beta in 1.9. With Kubernetes 1.25 we are excited to announce general availability(GA) of this feature.
Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. The lifetime of local ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod. It is exposed to pods using the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Before this feature was introduced, there were issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation, such as Pods not knowing how much local storage is available and being unable to request guaranteed local storage. Local storage is a best-effort resource and pods can be evicted due t…]]></summary>

The emergence of digital technologies has transformed decision making across commercial sectors such as airlines, online retailing, and internet advertising. Today, real-time decisions need to be repeatedly made in highly uncertain and rapidly changing environments. Moreover, organizations usually have limited resources, which need to be efficiently allocated across decisions. Such problems are referred to as online allocation problems with resource constraints, and applications abound. Some examples include:

I am happy to announce the 4.16.0 release of the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Theia.
major changes to the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse distribution


  
updated to Eclipse 2022-09 release (new and noteworthy)

  
new distribution build for Linux on ARM included now (experimental) - downloads are here

  
m2e 2.0.5 release included in distribution builds for Eclipse


important note for upgrading from a previous installation on Eclipse


  
Due to the major update to m2e 2.0 that comes with the Eclipse 2022-09 release, several additional third-party m2e connector extensions that the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse distribution had installed in the past are no longer compatible. This prevents the automatic update of installations of Spring Tool…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[There are multiple angles to look at workflows one of which is patterns. The Workflow Patterns initiative differentiates between control, data, and resource perspectives. They are not just focusing on the modeling language as such but have workflow systems in mind too. It’s valuable to have a closer look at those patterns and discuss which parts of it can be shown and even automated in BPMN, and which parts are taken care of in the technical implementation. I have seen BPMN diagrams that try to include every aspect in the diagram itself. This often leads to overloaded BPMN models with a lack of clear transparency of the business flow. Therefore, it is important to focus on all aspects of workflow...

In the lingua franca of modern IT architecture, latency is the perfect metaphor for an unresponsive business. If an organization’s latency is problematic, operations teams are always a step behind — reacting to events rather than anticipating them. 

But it doesn’t have to stay that way. 

For instance, Wells Fargo, a multinational financial services company headquartered in San Francisco, CA, realized that in order to measure performance of their myriad applications, they had to have a modern observability and APM solution in place. Eric Chho, vice president of engineering at Wells Fargo, is responsible for providing observability to the many application teams across Wells’ wide-ranging IT organization.

Advanced language models (e.g., GPT, GLaM, PaLM and T5) have demonstrated diverse capabilities and achieved impressive results across tasks and languages by scaling up their number of parameters. Vision-language (VL) models can benefit from similar scaling to address many tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), object recognition, and in-context optical-character-recognition (OCR). Increasing the success rates for these practical tasks is important for everyday interactions and applications. Furthermore, for a truly universal system, vision-language models should be able to operate in many languages, not just one.

This blog describes the two features namely minReadySeconds for StatefulSets and maxSurge for DaemonSets that SIG Apps is happy to graduate to stable in Kubernetes 1.25.
Specifying minReadySeconds slows down a rollout of a StatefulSet, when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field, by waiting for each pod for a desired time.
This time can be used for initializing the pod (e.g. warming up the cache) or as a delay before acknowledging the pod.
maxSurge allows a DaemonSet workload to run multiple instances of the same pod on a node during a rollout when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field.
This helps to minimize the downtime of the DaemonSet for consumers.

Kubernetes 1.25 introduces Alpha support for a new kubelet-managed pod condition
in the status field of a pod: PodHasNetwork. The kubelet, for a worker node,
will use the PodHasNetwork condition to accurately surface the initialization
state of a pod from the perspective of pod sandbox creation and network
configuration by a container runtime (typically in coordination with CNI
plugins). The kubelet starts to pull container images and start individual
containers (including init containers) after the status of the PodHasNetwork
condition is set to "True". Metrics collection services that report latency of
pod initialization from a cluster infrastructural perspective (i.e. agnostic of

An important aspect of human vision is our ability to comprehend 3D shape from the 2D images we observe. Achieving this kind of understanding with computer vision systems has been a fundamental challenge in the field. Many successful approaches rely on multi-view data, where two or more images of the same scene are available from different perspectives, which makes it much easier to infer the 3D shape of objects in the images. 
There are, however, many situations where it would be useful to know 3D structure from a single image, but this problem is generally difficult or impossible to solve. For example, it isn’t necessarily possible to tell the difference between an …]]></summary>

A long-standing request from the Kubernetes community has been to have a

Motivation
With the growing number of eyes on Kubernetes, the number of CVEs related to

An important promise for quadrupedal robots is their potential to operate in complex outdoor environments that are difficult or inaccessible for humans. Whether it’s to find natural resources deep in the mountains, or to search for life signals in heavily-damaged earthquake sites, a robust and versatile quadrupedal robot could be very helpful. To achieve that, a robot needs to perceive the environment, understand its locomotion challenges, and adapt its locomotion skill accordingly. While recent advances in perceptive locomotion have greatly enhanced the capability of quadrupedal robots, most works focus on indoor or urban environments, thus they cannot effectively handle the complexity of off-road terrains.

With Kubernetes v1.25, SIG Auth is introducing a new v2alpha1 version of the Key Management Service (KMS) API. There are a lot of improvements in the works, and we're excited to be able to start down the path of a new and improved KMS!
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting persisted API data at rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption.
Encryption at rest using KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version v1.10, and is currently in beta as of version v1.12.

Convolutional neural networks have been the dominant machine learning architecture for computer vision since the introduction of AlexNet in 2012. Recently, inspired by the evolution of Transformers in natural language processing, attention mechanisms have been prominently incorporated into vision models. These attention methods boost some parts of the input data while minimizing other parts so that the network can focus on small but important parts of the data. The Vision Transformer (ViT) has created a new landscape of model designs for computer vision that is completely free of convolution. ViT regards image patches as a sequence of words, and applies a Transformer encoder on top. When trained on sufficiently la…]]></summary>

Some Kubernetes components (such as kubelet and kube-proxy) create
iptables chains and rules as part of their operation. These chains
were never intended to be part of any Kubernetes API/ABI guarantees,
but some external components nonetheless make use of some of them (in
particular, using KUBE-MARK-MASQ to mark packets as needing to be
masqueraded).
As a part of the v1.25 release, SIG Network made this declaration
explicit: that (with one exception), the iptables chains that
Kubernetes creates are intended only for Kubernetes’s own internal
use, and third-party components should not assume that Kubernetes will
create any specific iptables chains, or that those chains will contain
any specific rules if they do exist.

Did you ever try to measure a smell? …Until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor. If you are ambitious to found a new science, measure a smell.
  
— Alexander Graham Bell, 1914.

 How can we measure a smell? Smells are produced by molecules that waft through the air, enter our noses, and bind to sensory receptors. Potentially billions of molecules can produce a smell, so figuring out which ones produce which smells is difficult to catalog or predict. Sensory maps can help us solve this problem.  Color vision has the most familiar examples of these maps, from the color wheel we each learn in primary school to more sophisticated variants used to perform color correc…]]></summary>

This article introduces the Container Object Storage Interface (COSI), a standard for provisioning and consuming object storage in Kubernetes. It is an alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.25.
File and block storage are treated as first class citizens in the Kubernetes ecosystem via Container Storage Interface (CSI). Workloads using CSI volumes enjoy the benefits of portability across vendors and across Kubernetes clusters without the need to change application manifests. An equivalent standard does not exist for Object storage.
Object storage has been rising in popularity in recent years as an alternative form of storage to filesystems and block devices. Object storage paradigm promotes disaggregation of compute and storage. This is done by making data avail…]]></summary>

Patent documents typically use legal and highly technical language, with context-dependent terms that may have meanings quite different from colloquial usage and even between different documents. The process of using traditional patent search methods (e.g., keyword searching) to search through the corpus of over one hundred million patent documents can be tedious and result in many missed results due to the broad and non-standard language used. For example, a "soccer ball" may be described as a "spherical recreation device", "inflatable sportsball" or "ball for ball game".

Kubernetes 1.25 brings cgroup v2 to GA (general availability), letting the
kubelet use the latest container resource
management capabilities.
What are cgroups?
Effective resource management is a
critical aspect of Kubernetes. This involves managing the finite resources in
your nodes, such as CPU, memory, and storage.
cgroups are a Linux kernel capability that establish resource management
functionality like limiting CPU usage or setting memory limits for running
processes.
When you use the resource management capabilities in Kubernetes, such as configuring
requests and limits for Pods and containers,
Kubernetes uses cgroups to enforce your resource requests and limits.
The Linux kernel offers two versions of cgroups: cgroup v1 and cgr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Jonathan Dobson (Red Hat)
CSI Inline Volumes were introduced as an alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.15 and have been beta since 1.16. We are happy to announce that this feature has graduated to General Availability (GA) status in Kubernetes 1.25.
CSI Inline Volumes are similar to other ephemeral volume types, such as configMap, downwardAPI and secret. The important difference is that the storage is provided by a CSI driver, which allows the use of ephemeral storage provided by third-party vendors. The volume is defined as part of the pod spec and follows the lifecycle of the pod, meaning the volume is created once the pod is scheduled and destroyed when the pod is destroyed.
What's new in 1.25?
There are a couple of new bug fixes related to this feature in 1.25, and the CSIInlineVolum…]]></summary>
