It’s raining outside. I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked!

We're building this neat service in Python to ingest data in Elasticsearch from various sources (MySQL, Network Drive, AWS, etc.) for Enterprise Search.
Sucking data from a third-party service to Elasticsearch is usually an I/O-bound activity. Your code sits on opened sockets and passes data from one end to the other. That's a great use case for an asynchronous application in Python, but it needs to be carefully crafted.
When data flows through that pipeline, we want to ensure we don't blow the available resources (RAM/CPU/FDs). We also want to maximize the output without killing Elasticsearch or the backend service.
So it's all about implementing the right throttling and backpressure safeguards and surfacing the right settings, so you can properly size how aggressive the service will be…]]></summary>

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:

Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod's scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler's performance. See …]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced generally available (GA) support for kubelet credential
provider plugins,
offering an extensible plugin framework to dynamically fetch credentials
for any container image registry.
Background
Kubernetes supports the ability to dynamically fetch credentials for a container registry service.
Prior to Kubernetes v1.20, this capability was compiled into the kubelet and only available for
Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, and Google Cloud Container Registry.

Analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has a tremendous potential for enhancing patient care, quantitatively measuring performance of clinical practices, and facilitating clinical research. Statistical estimation and machine learning (ML) models trained on EHR data can be used to predict the probability of various diseases (such as diabetes), track patient wellness, and predict how patients respond to specific drugs. For such models, researchers and practitioners need access to EHR data. However, it can be challenging to leverage EHR data while ensuring data privacy and conforming to patient confidentiality regulations (such as HIPAA).

He’s been doing this job for a long time. But in 2022, his sleigh got an upgrade thanks to Kibana dashboards! He is now able to track the cities he’s visited along the way, the state of his journey, and his cool Christmas playlist.

Differential privacy (DP) is an approach that enables data analytics and machine learning (ML) with a mathematical guarantee on the privacy of user data.  DP quantifies the “privacy cost” of an algorithm, i.e., the level of guarantee that the algorithm’s output distribution for a given dataset will not change significantly if a single user’s data is added to or removed from it. The algorithm is characterized by two parameters, ε and δ, where smaller values of both indicate “more private”. There is a natural tension between the privacy budget (ε, δ) and the utility of the algorithm: a smaller privacy budget requires the output to be more “noisy”, often leading to less utility. Thus, a fundamental goal of D…]]></summary>

Log files and system logs have been a treasure trove of information for administrators and developers for decades. But with more moving parts and ever more options on where to run modern cloud applications, keeping an eye on logs and troubleshooting problems have become increasingly difficult. 

While it’s often possible to ssh into a server and run commands like tail -f, this approach doesn’t scale for most developers and administrators. Even if you’re good on the command line, you might be able to find what you’re looking for in a log file using awk and grep and could even calculate some simple statistics around how often certain errors occur. But what if the applications are running across hundreds of servers or Kubernetes pods? Or even worse, what if the applications are split across…]]></summary>

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is

Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…]]></summary>

The structured nature of Kubernetes enables a repeatable and scalable means of deploying and managing services and applications. This has led to widespread adoption across market verticals for both on-premises and cloud deployment models. The autonomous nature of Kubernetes operation, however, demands comprehensive, fully-converged observability and security. This is uniquely possible today using the Elastic platform.

With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally

Within the kubelet, the Device Manager facilitates communication with device plugins
using gRPC through Unix sockets. Device Manager and Device plugins both act as gRPC
servers and clients by serving and connecting to the exposed gRPC services respectively.

Language models (LMs) are the driving force behind many recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. Models like T5, LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM have demonstrated impressive performance on various language tasks. While multiple factors can contribute to improving the performance of LMs, some recent studies suggest that scaling up the model’s size is crucial for revealing emergent capabilities. In other words, some instances can be solved by small models, while others seem to benefit from increased scale. 

Despite recent efforts that enabled the efficient training of LMs over large amounts of data, trained models can still be slow and costly for practical use. When generating text at inference time, most autoregressive LMs …]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.24 introduced an alpha quality implementation of improvements
for handling a non-graceful node shutdown.
In Kubernetes v1.26, this feature moves to beta. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shut down or in a non-recoverable state, such as the hardware failure or broken OS.
What is a node shutdown in Kubernetes?
In a Kubernetes cluster, it is possible for a node to shut down. This could happen either in a planned way or it could happen unexpectedly. You may plan for a security patch, or a kernel upgrade and need to reboot the node, or it may shut down due to preemption of VM instances. A node may also shut down due to a hardware failure or a software problem.

This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the

In 2019 we launched Recorder, an audio recording app for Pixel phones that helps users create, manage, and edit audio recordings. It leverages recent developments in on-device machine learning to transcribe speech, recognize audio events, suggest tags for titles, and help users navigate transcripts. 
 
Nonetheless, some Recorder users found it difficult to navigate long recordings that have multiple speakers because it's not clear who said what. During the Made By Google event this year, we announced the "speaker labels" feature for the Recorder app. This opt-in feature annotates a recording transcript with unique and anonymous labels for each speaker (e.g., "Speaker 1", "Speaker 2", etc.)…]]></summary>

Major recent advances in multiple subfields of machine learning (ML) research, such as computer vision and natural language processing, have been enabled by a shared common approach that leverages large, diverse datasets and expressive models that can absorb all of the data effectively. Although there have been various attempts to apply this approach to robotics, robots have not yet leveraged highly-capable models as well as other subfields. 

Several factors contribute to this challenge. First, there’s the lack of large-scale and diverse robotic data, which limits a model’s ability to absorb a broad set of robotic experiences. Data collection is particularly expensive and challenging for robotics bec…]]></summary>

The long-awaited day has arrived: HostProcess containers, the Windows equivalent to Linux privileged

What are HostProcess containers and why are they useful?
Cluster operators are often faced with the need to configure their nodes upon provisioning such as
installing Windows services, configuring registry keys, managing TLS certificates,
making network configuration changes, or even deploying monitoring tools such as a Prometheus's node-exporter.
Previously, performing these actions on Windows nodes was usually done by running PowerShell scripts
over SSH or WinRM sessions and/or working with your cloud provider's virtual machine management tooling.

The Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) Release is proud to announce that we

Signing artifacts provides end users a chance to verify the integrity of the
downloaded resource. It allows to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks directly on
the client side and therefore ensures the trustfulness of the remote serving the
artifacts. The overall goal of out past work was to define the used tooling for
signing all Kubernetes related artifacts as well as providing a standard signing
process for related projects (for example for those in kubernetes-sigs).

made possible due to the use of a diverse and complex set of computing resources, spread out through
multiple datacenters and regions worldwide. The end result of a release - the binaries, the image

When quantum computers were first proposed, they were hoped to be a way to better understand the quantum world. With a so-called “quantum simulator,” one could engineer a quantum computer to investigate how various quantum phenomena arise, including those that are intractable to simulate with a classical computer.  
    
But making a useful quantum simulator has been a challenge. Until now, quantum simulations with superconducting qubits have predominantly been used to verify pre-existing theoretical predictions and have rarely explored or discovered new phenomena. Only a few experiments with trapped ions or cold atoms have revealed new insights. Superconducting qubits, even though they are one of the main…]]></summary>

Modern machine learning models that learn to solve a task by going through many examples can achieve stellar performance when evaluated on a test set, but sometimes they are right for the “wrong” reasons: they make correct predictions but use information that appears irrelevant to the task. How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label. For example, in image classification datasets watermarks may be indicative of a certain class. Or it can happen that all the pictures of dogs happen to be taken outside, against green grass, so a green background become…]]></summary>

Forensic container checkpointing is based on Checkpoint/Restore In
Userspace (CRIU) and allows the creation of stateful copies
of a running container without the container knowing that it is being
checkpointed. The copy of the container can be analyzed and restored in a
sandbox environment multiple times without the original container being aware
of it. Forensic container checkpointing was introduced as an alpha feature in
Kubernetes v1.25.
How does it work?
With the help of CRIU it is possible to checkpoint and restore containers.
CRIU is integrated in runc, crun, CRI-O and containerd and forensic container
checkpointing as implemented in Kubernetes uses these existing CRIU
integrations.
Why is it important?

Debugging software in production is one of the biggest challenges we have to
face in our containerized environments. Being able to understand the impact of
the available security options, especially when it comes to configuring our
deployments, is one of the key aspects to make the default security in
Kubernetes stronger. We have all those logging, tracing and metrics data already
at hand, but how do we assemble the information they provide into something
human readable and actionable?
Seccomp is one of the standard mechanisms to protect a Linux based
Kubernetes application from malicious actions by interfering with its system
calls. This allows us to restrict the application to a defined set of
actionable items, like modifying files or responding to HTTP requests. …]]></summary>

A grand vision in robot learning, going back to the SHRDLU experiments in the late 1960s, is that of helpful robots that inhabit human spaces and follow a wide variety of natural language commands. Over the last few years, there have been significant advances in the application of machine learning (ML) for instruction following, both in simulation and in real world systems. Recent Palm-SayCan work has produced robots that leverage language models to plan long-horizon behaviors and reason about abstract goals.

When speaking about observability in the cloud native space, then probably
everyone will mention OpenTelemetry (OTEL) at some point in the
conversation. That's great, because the community needs standards to rely on
for developing all cluster components into the same direction. OpenTelemetry
enables us to combine logs, metrics, traces and other contextual information
(called baggage) into a single resource. Cluster administrators or software
engineers can use this resource to get a viewport about what is going on in the
cluster over a defined period of time. But how can Kubernetes itself make use of
this technology stack?
Kubernetes consists of multiple components where some are independent and others
are stacked together. Looking at the architecture from a containe…]]></summary>

Wormholes — wrinkles in the fabric of spacetime that connect two disparate locations — may seem like the stuff of science fiction. But whether or not they exist in reality, studying these hypothetical objects could be the key to making concrete the tantalizing link between information and matter that has bedeviled physicists for decades.  
  
Surprisingly, a quantum computer is an ideal platform to investigate this connection. The trick is to use a correspondence called AdS/CFT, which establishes an equivalence between a theory that describes gravity and spacetime (and wormholes) in a fictional world with a special geometry (AdS) to a quantum theory that does not contain gravity at all …]]></summary>

In recent years, language models (LMs) have become more prominent in natural language processing (NLP) research and are also becoming increasingly impactful in practice. Scaling up LMs has been shown to improve performance across a range of NLP tasks. For instance, scaling up language models can improve perplexity across seven orders of magnitude of model sizes, and new abilities such as multi-step reasoning have been observed to arise as a result of model scale. However, one of the challenges of continued scaling is that training new, larger models requires great amounts of computational resources.
