The main theme of this milestone is the improvement of job parameters handling in Spring Batch. Two main changes were introduced in this release:


  
Add support to use any type as a job parameter

  
Improve job parameters conversion


This blog post walks through these two major changes in details. For the complete list of changes, please check the release notes.
Add support to use any type as a job parameter

Up to version 4, Spring Batch supported only 4 types that can be used as job parameters, which are long, double, String and Date. While this was convenient to simplify job parameters handling on the framework’s side, it turns out t…]]></summary>

We expect the brand new Third Party Security Audit of Kubernetes will be
published later this month (Oct 2022).
In preparation for that, let's look at the state of findings that were made
public as part of the last third party security audit of
2019
that was based on Kubernetes v1.13.4.
Motivation
Craig Ingram has graciously attempted over the years to keep track of the
status of the findings reported in the last audit in this issue:
kubernetes/kubernetes#81146.
This blog post will attempt to dive deeper into this, address any gaps
in tracking and become a point in time summary of the state of the
findings reported from 2019.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Fitsum Reda and Janne Kontkanen, Google Research 
Frame interpolation is the process of synthesizing in-between images from a given set of images. The technique is often used for temporal up-sampling to increase the refresh rate of videos or to create slow motion effects. Nowadays, with digital cameras and smartphones, we often take several photos within a few seconds to capture the best picture. Interpolating between these “near-duplicate” photos can lead to engaging videos that reveal scene motion, often delivering an even more pleasing sense of the moment than the original photos.  
  
Frame interpolation between consecutive video frames, which often have small motion, has been studied extensively. Unlike videos, however, the temporal spacing between near-duplicate photos can …]]></summary>

So, what is Universal Profiling™? Universal Profiling™ is fast emerging as an important component of observability. A standard feature inside hyperscalers since approximately 2010, the technology is slowly percolating into the wider industry. Universal Profiling™ allows you to see what your code is doing all the time, in production across a wide range of languages and can profile both user-space and kernel-space code. It can be used in containerized or non-containerized environments, and provides a powerful UI to unearth inefficiencies and optimization opportunities throughout your entire fleet. 


As recently as two to three years ago, very few fleet-wide continuous profiling products existed. As of 2022, there is a plethora of APM vendors and other projects that provide some form of co…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Authors: Rodrigo Campos (Microsoft), Giuseppe Scrivano (Red Hat)
Kubernetes v1.25 introduces the support for user namespaces.
This is a major improvement for running secure workloads in
Kubernetes. Each pod will have access only to a limited subset of the
available UIDs and GIDs on the system, thus adding a new security
layer to protect from other pods running on the same system.
How does it work?
A process running on Linux can use up to 4294967296 different UIDs and
GIDs.
User namespaces is a Linux feature that allows mapping a set of users
in the container to different users in the host, thus restricting what
IDs a process can effectively use.
Furthermore, the capabilities granted in a new user namespace do not
apply in the host initial namespaces.
Why is it important?
There are mainly t…]]></summary>

This means it’s syntactically closer to code than human-readable sentences. Since one of the goals of FEEL is to be “process analyst friendly,” it prioritizes readability more than other expression...

Immutable fields can be found in a few places in the built-in Kubernetes types.
For example, you can't change the .metadata.name of an object. Specific objects
have fields where changes to existing objects are constrained; for example, the
.spec.selector of a Deployment.
Aside from simple immutability, there are other common design patterns such as
lists which are append-only, or a map with mutable values and immutable keys.
Until recently the best way to restrict field mutability for CustomResourceDefinitions
has been to create a validating
admission webhook:
this means a lot of complexity for the common case of making a field immutable.
Beta since Kubernetes 1.25, CEL Validation Rules allow CRD authors to express
validation constraints on their fields…]]></summary>

Requirements To understand this blog post, it is useful to have a certain understanding of Kubernetes and Zeebe itself. Summer Hackdays: Hackdays are a regular event at Camunda, where people from different departments (engineering, consulting, DevRel, etc.) work together on new ideas, pet projects, and more.

Deep reinforcement learning (RL) continues to make great strides in solving real-world sequential decision-making problems such as balloon navigation, nuclear physics, robotics, and games. Despite its promise, one of its limiting factors is long training times. While the current approach to speed up RL training on complex and difficult tasks leverages distributed training scaling up to hundreds or even thousands of computing nodes, it still requires the use of significant hardware resources which makes RL training expensive, while increasing its environmental impact. However, recent work [1, 2] indicates that performance optimizations on existing hardware …]]></summary>

In Kubernetes 1.25, Validation rules for CustomResourceDefinitions (CRDs) have graduated to Beta!
Validation rules make it possible to declare how custom resources are validated using the Common Expression Language (CEL). For example:
apiVersion: apiextensions.k8s.io/v1
kind: CustomResourceDefinition
 ...
 openAPIV3Schema:
 type: object
 properties:
 spec:
 type: object
 x-kubernetes-validations:
 - rule: "self.minReplicas <= self.replicas && self.replicas <= self.maxReplicas"
 message: "replicas should be in the range minReplicas..maxReplicas."
 properties:
 replicas:
 type: integer

Validation rules support a wide range of use cases. To get a sense of some of the capabilities, let's look at a few examples:

Many exciting contemporary applications of computer science and machine learning (ML) manipulate multidimensional datasets that span a single large coordinate system, for example, weather modeling from atmospheric measurements over a spatial grid or medical imaging predictions from multi-channel image intensity values in a 2d or 3d scan. In these settings, even a single dataset may require terabytes or petabytes of data storage. Such datasets are also challenging to work with as users may read and write data at irregular intervals and varying scales, and are often interested in performing analyses using numerous machines working in parallel.

Its goal is to be easy to understand, and at the same time, be full-featured enough to handle decision tables and literal expressions. When business and IT often work together on complex projects, writing expressions in a (relatively) accessible way reduces miscommunications and helps align teams. Camunda uses FEEL to map and transform business process data dynamically. For example, a loan application process pulls a credit score from an API call into a decision table. The decision table automates the next step of the process depending on the rules in the table. The data from the decision automation can then be...

A long-standing problem in the intersection of computer vision and computer graphics, view synthesis is the task of creating new views of a scene from multiple pictures of that scene. This has received increased attention [1, 2, 3] since the introduction of neural radiance fields (NeRF). The problem is challenging because to accurately synthesize new views of a scene, a model needs to capture many types of information — its detailed 3D structure, materials, and illumination —  from a small set of reference images.  
In this post, we present recently published deep learning models for view synthesis. In “Light Field Neural Rendering” (LFNR), presented at CVPR 2022, we address the challenge of accurately repro…]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.25, released earlier this month, introduced a new feature

volumes requires a secret (for example: a credential for accessing a SAN fabric)
to perform node expand operation. This new behavior is in alpha and you
must enable a feature gate (CSINodeExpandSecret) to make use of it.
You must also be using CSI
storage; this change isn't relevant to storage drivers that are built in to Kubernetes.
To turn on this new, alpha feature, you enable the CSINodeExpandSecret feature
gate for the kube-apiserver and kubelet, which turns on a mechanism to send secretRef

Natural language enables flexible descriptive queries about images. The interaction between text queries and images grounds linguistic meaning in the visual world, facilitating a better understanding of object relationships, human intentions towards objects, and interactions with the environment. The research community has studied object-level visual grounding through a range of tasks, including referring expression comprehension, text-based localization, and more broadly object detection, each of which require different skills in a model. For example, object detection seeks to find all objects from a predefined set of classes, which requires accurate localization and classification, while referr…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[I’m pleased to announce the first milestone release of Spring for GraphQL 1.1.0 is now available from our Milestone repository. This version will be shipped with Spring Boot 3.0.0-M5 due for release later this week.

Spring Boot 3.0 is around the corner and the community is expecting a compatible Spring for GraphQL version to go with it. Currently, the best way to prepare for the Spring Boot 3.0 upgrade is to upgrade to Spring Boot 2.7 and Java 17, but Spring Boot 3.0 has new baseline requirements, namely Java 17, Jakarta APIs and Spring Framework 6.0.

Given that Spring for GraphQL 1.0.0 was released towards the end of May this year, we didn’t feel we would have enough time nor feedback to go with a major release of the project for Boot 3.0. This is why the goal of the 1.1 release is simply to adapt to the new baseline requirements and provide a smooth upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0 for existing projects.

This first milestone brings those foundational changes: the Java 17, Jakarta APIs, and a Spring Framework 6.0 baseline. We’re also taking the opportunity to upgrade to GraphQL Java 19.x – a painless upgrade on our side, thanks to the GraphQL Java team! We’ve also replaced our internally developed context propagation mechanism with the new Micrometer Context Propagation library, that’s intended for use broadly across Spring projects. It allows Spring applications to propagate context across various such mechanisms, e.g. ThreadLocal, Reactor Context, GraphQLContext, and others.

In the next milestones, we will consider how we can adapt our current arrangement with important themes in Spring Boot 3.0: GraalVM native image and Micrometer Observability support. Given the short timeline, we might schedule some changes for a future version – again, a smooth upgrade is our top priority here.
How can you help?

If you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.

Local ephemeral storage capacity isolation was introduced as a alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.7 and it went beta in 1.9. With Kubernetes 1.25 we are excited to announce general availability(GA) of this feature.
Pods use ephemeral local storage for scratch space, caching, and logs. The lifetime of local ephemeral storage does not extend beyond the life of the individual pod. It is exposed to pods using the container’s writable layer, logs directory, and EmptyDir volumes. Before this feature was introduced, there were issues related to the lack of local storage accounting and isolation, such as Pods not knowing how much local storage is available and being unable to request guaranteed local storage.

The Workflow Patterns initiative differentiates between control, data, and resource perspectives. They are not just focusing on the modeling language as such but have workflow systems in mind too. It’s valuable to have a closer look at those patterns and discuss which parts of it can be shown and even automated in BPMN, and which parts are taken care of in the technical implementation. I have seen BPMN diagrams that try to include every aspect in the diagram itself. This often leads to overloaded BPMN models with a lack of clear transparency of the business flow. Therefore, it is important to focus on all aspects of workflow...

Advanced language models (e.g., GPT, GLaM, PaLM and T5) have demonstrated diverse capabilities and achieved impressive results across tasks and languages by scaling up their number of parameters. Vision-language (VL) models can benefit from similar scaling to address many tasks, such as image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), object recognition, and in-context optical-character-recognition (OCR). Increasing the success rates for these practical tasks is important for everyday interactions and applications. Furthermore, for a truly universal system, vision-language models should be able to operate in many languages, not just one.

This blog describes the two features namely minReadySeconds for StatefulSets and maxSurge for DaemonSets that SIG Apps is happy to graduate to stable in Kubernetes 1.25.
Specifying minReadySeconds slows down a rollout of a StatefulSet, when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field, by waiting for each pod for a desired time.
This time can be used for initializing the pod (e.g. warming up the cache) or as a delay before acknowledging the pod.
maxSurge allows a DaemonSet workload to run multiple instances of the same pod on a node during a rollout when using a RollingUpdate value in .spec.updateStrategy field.
This helps to minimize the downtime of the DaemonSet for consumers.

Kubernetes 1.25 introduces Alpha support for a new kubelet-managed pod condition

will use the PodHasNetwork condition to accurately surface the initialization
state of a pod from the perspective of pod sandbox creation and network
configuration by a container runtime (typically in coordination with CNI
plugins). The kubelet starts to pull container images and start individual
containers (including init containers) after the status of the PodHasNetwork

An important aspect of human vision is our ability to comprehend 3D shape from the 2D images we observe. Achieving this kind of understanding with computer vision systems has been a fundamental challenge in the field. Many successful approaches rely on multi-view data, where two or more images of the same scene are available from different perspectives, which makes it much easier to infer the 3D shape of objects in the images. 
There are, however, many situations where it would be useful to know 3D structure from a single image, but this problem is generally difficult or impossible to solve. For example, it isn’t necessarily possible to tell the difference between an …]]></summary>

A long-standing request from the Kubernetes community has been to have a
programmatic way for end users to keep track of Kubernetes security issues
(also called "CVEs", after the database that tracks public security issues across
different products and vendors). Accompanying the release of Kubernetes v1.25,
we are excited to announce availability of such
a feed as an alpha
feature. This blog will cover the background and scope of this new service.
Motivation
With the growing number of eyes on Kubernetes, the number of CVEs related to
Kubernetes have increased. Although most CVEs that directly, indirectly, or
transitively impact Kubernetes are regularly fixed, there is no single place for
the end users of Kubernetes to programmatically subscribe or pull the…]]></summary>

An important promise for quadrupedal robots is their potential to operate in complex outdoor environments that are difficult or inaccessible for humans. Whether it’s to find natural resources deep in the mountains, or to search for life signals in heavily-damaged earthquake sites, a robust and versatile quadrupedal robot could be very helpful. To achieve that, a robot needs to perceive the environment, understand its locomotion challenges, and adapt its locomotion skill accordingly. While recent advances in perceptive locomotion have greatly enhanced the capability of quadrupedal robots, most works focus on indoor or urban environments, thus they cannot effectively handle the complexity of off-road terrains.

With Kubernetes v1.25, SIG Auth is introducing a new v2alpha1 version of the Key Management Service (KMS) API. There are a lot of improvements in the works, and we're excited to be able to start down the path of a new and improved KMS!
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting persisted API data at rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to perform this encryption.
Encryption at rest using KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version v1.10, and is currently in beta as of version v1.12.

Convolutional neural networks have been the dominant machine learning architecture for computer vision since the introduction of AlexNet in 2012. Recently, inspired by the evolution of Transformers in natural language processing, attention mechanisms have been prominently incorporated into vision models. These attention methods boost some parts of the input data while minimizing other parts so that the network can focus on small but important parts of the data. The Vision Transformer (ViT) has created a new landscape of model designs for computer vision that is completely free of convolution. ViT regards image patches as a sequence of words, and applies a Transformer encoder on top. When trained on sufficiently la…]]></summary>

Some Kubernetes components (such as kubelet and kube-proxy) create

particular, using KUBE-MARK-MASQ to mark packets as needing to be
masqueraded).
As a part of the v1.25 release, SIG Network made this declaration
explicit: that (with one exception), the iptables chains that
Kubernetes creates are intended only for Kubernetes’s own internal
use, and third-party components should not assume that Kubernetes will
create any specific iptables chains, or that those chains will contain
any specific rules if they do exist.

Did you ever try to measure a smell? …Until you can measure their likenesses and differences you can have no science of odor. If you are ambitious to found a new science, measure a smell.
  
— Alexander Graham Bell, 1914.

 How can we measure a smell? Smells are produced by molecules that waft through the air, enter our noses, and bind to sensory receptors. Potentially billions of molecules can produce a smell, so figuring out which ones produce which smells is difficult to catalog or predict. Sensory maps can help us solve this problem.  Color vision has the most familiar examples of these maps, from the color wheel we each learn in primary school to more sophisticated variants used to perform color correc…]]></summary>
