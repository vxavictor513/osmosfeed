Time-series forecasting is ubiquitous in various domains, such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that improving demand forecasting accuracy can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models dominated the M5 competition leaderboard).



At the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation, retrieval-augmented generation, and code completion. …]]></summary>

Machine learning models in the real world are often trained on limited data that may contain unintended statistical biases. For example, in the CELEBA celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting “blond” as the hair color for most female faces — here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as medical diagnosis. 





Surprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to amplify such statistical biases, through the so-called simplicity bias of deep learning. T…]]></summary>

Text-to-image diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, and Imagen). While recent advancements in inference solutions on Android via MediaPipe and iOS via Core ML have been made in the past year, rapid (sub-second) text-to-image generation on mobile devices has remained out of reach.

“I saw that Elastic was getting into the AI space,” Steve says. “So, I asked the head of AI to come on my personal podcast to see what Elastic thought of AI. After the podcast, I said I’d love to talk about working with you.” 

After a months-long conversation about what he could help with, Steve rejoined Elastic as an AI & Search Go-to-market Specialist. In his new role, Steve goes out into the field and helps potential customers define requirements and figure out how Elastic can help and what they can achieve together.

2. Optimized for Throughput
The Optimized for Throughput preset focuses on achieving 4x higher data ingestion rates, making it ideal for scenarios where you need Agent to handle high volumes of events. It takes the best parts of the Balanced preset but more freely consumes CPU and memory and multiplexes events across multiple additional connections to Elasticsearch.

AI-driven technologies are weaving themselves into the fabric of our daily routines, with the potential to enhance our access to knowledge and boost our overall productivity. The backbone of these applications lies in large language models (LLMs).  LLMs are memory-intensive and typically require specialized hardware accelerators to efficiently deliver tens of exaflops of computing power. This blog post shows how we can start addressing the computational challenges by utilizing memory more effectively.



The bulk of an LLM’s memory and compute are consumed by weights in matrix multiplication operations. Using narrower data types reduces memory consumption. For example, storing weights in the 8-bit integer (i.e., U8 or S8)…]]></summary>

“In college, I didn’t even know support was an option. I thought I would end up working at a help desk or as a developer in a company,” Kesia shares. “My first exposure to support was actually as a trainee with IBM. They allocated me to this thing called ‘support’ and had me start debugging files.”
Despite her hesitancy at the jump, that trainee experience opened Kesia’s eyes to a new realm of possibilities — one that aligned perfectly with both her social disposition and love of solving problems. Fast forward 10 years, and Kesia is now thriving as a full-time support engineer with Elastic, the leading platform for search-powered solutions with a robust support department.

There is an urgent call to action for organizations to think about and implement cybersecurity processes and technologies more strategically. The study shed some positive light for telecom companies as compared to peer industries. But, the MTTx (detect, respond, mitigate) and threat dwell time are high enough to raise serious concerns about how well armed the industry is to protect such critical network infrastructure.

And in Europe, the latest cybersecurity report from European Union Agency for Cybersecurity (ENISA)2 states that telecommunications were the target for 26% of DDoS attacks, a fourfold increase from 2021 due to remote working.

Graphs, in which objects and their relations are represented as nodes (or vertices) and edges (or links) between pairs of nodes, are ubiquitous in computing and machine learning (ML). For example, social networks, road networks, and molecular structure and interactions are all domains in which underlying datasets have a natural graph structure. ML can be used to learn the properties of nodes, edges, or entire graphs. 




A common approach to learning on graphs are graph neural networks (GNNs), which operate on graph data by applying an optimizable transformation on node, edge, and global attributes. The most typical class of GNNs operates via a message-passing framework,…]]></summary>

A common issue in running/operating Kubernetes clusters is running out of disk space.
When the node is provisioned, you should aim to have a good amount of storage space for your container images and running containers.
The container runtime usually writes to /var.
This can be located as a separate partition or on the root filesystem.
CRI-O, by default, writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containers, while containerd writes its containers and images to /var/lib/containerd.
In this blog post, we want to bring attention to ways that you can configure your container runtime to store its content separately from the default partition.
One area that needs more explaining is where/what Kubernetes is writing to disk.

In the fast-evolving landscape of artificial intelligence, large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized the way we interact with machines, pushing the boundaries of natural language understanding and generation to unprecedented heights. Yet, the leap into high-stakes decision-making applications remains a chasm too wide, primarily due to the inherent uncertainty of model predictions. Traditional LLMs generate responses recursively, yet they lack an intrinsic mechanism to assign a confidence score to these responses. Although one can derive a confidence score by summing up the probabilities of individual tokens in the sequence, traditional approaches typically fall short in reliably dist…]]></summary>

The physician-patient conversation is a cornerstone of medicine, in which skilled and intentional communication drives diagnosis, management, empathy and trust. AI systems capable of such diagnostic dialogues could increase availability, accessibility, quality and consistency of care by being useful conversational partners to clinicians and patients alike. But approximating clinicians’ considerable expertise is a significant challenge. 





Recent progress in large language models (LLMs) outside the medical domain has shown that they can plan, reason, and use relevant context to hold rich conversations. However, there are many aspects of good diagnostic dialogue that are unique to the medical domain. …]]></summary>

LLMs are increasingly popular for reasoning tasks, such as multi-turn QA, task completion, code generation, or mathematics. Yet much like people, they do not always solve problems correctly on the first try, especially on tasks for which they were not trained. Therefore, for such systems to be most useful, they should be able to 1) identify where their reasoning went wrong and 2) backtrack to find another solution.



This has led to a surge in methods related to self-correction, where an LLM is used to identify problems in its own output, and then produce improved results based on the feedback. Self-correction is generally thought of as a single process, but we decided to break it down into two components, mistake finding and output corre…]]></summary>
