People don’t write in the same way that they speak. Written language is controlled and deliberate, whereas transcripts of spontaneous speech (like interviews) are hard to read because speech is disorganized and less fluent. One aspect that makes speech transcripts particularly difficult to read is disfluency, which includes self-corrections, repetitions, and filled pauses (e.g., words like “umm”, and “you know”). Following is an example of a spoken sentence with disfluencies from the LDC CALLHOME corpus: 
But that's it's not, it's not, it's, uh, it's a word play on what you just said.
It takes some time to understand this sentence — the listener must filter out the extraneous words and resolve all of the nots. Remo…]]></summary>

Language models have demonstrated remarkable performance on a variety of natural language tasks — indeed, a general lesson from many works, including BERT, GPT-3, Gopher, and PaLM, has been that neural networks trained on diverse data at large scale in an unsupervised way can perform well on a variety of tasks. 
Quantitative reasoning is one area in which language models still fall far short of human-level performance.

When the average organization experiences 26 cyber attacks per year, being prepared for the aftermath of a breach is just as important as prevention.

With the ever-evolving nature of attacks and the increasing complexity of organizational systems, it’s harder than ever to have a fast response ready to go for any potential scenario that might arise.Case in point: a recent survey of 1,200 organizations by ThoughtLab (and cosponsored by Elastic) shows that more than a quarter of executives fear their organizations aren’t fully prepared for cyber attacks. 

However, Cybersecurity Solutions for a Riskier World also reveals best practices for incident response and recovery from the top cybersecurity executives in 16 countries and across 14 industries. In the unfortunate event of a breach, pri…]]></summary>

An impactful customer experience that drives purchases and loyalty isn't just about delivering what a customer says they want — it's about predicting and proactively serving up what they need. 

We might be able to imagine this work in a store with salespeople. But as organizations scale and customer interactions happen across digital and in-person mediums, their data grows. E-commerce must lean on the latest in machine learning and artificial intelligence to deliver a personalized sales experience. 

That means relying on a powerful search box.

Let’s take a look at how Elastic’s machine learning capabilities are powering this kind of e-commerce personalization. But first, let’s talk about what’s at stake.

Support for new hardware profiles are continuously added to provide better price-performance on our Cloud platform.

With the release of the hardware profile migration capability, you now have the flexibility to switch between hardware profiles on your existing deployment. You can see the current hardware profile on each deployment’s Overview page, have the ability to edit the profile, and select a new one. This allows you to take advantage of more efficient hardware available on cloud providers, like Graviton2-based instances on AWS, N2 machines on GCP, or Edsv4, Ddv4, or Fsv2 VMs on Azure, with the added benefit of simplifying your migration process.

In efforts to learn about the quantum world, scientists face a big obstacle: their classical experience of the world. Whenever a quantum system is measured, the act of this measurement destroys the “quantumness” of the state. For example, if the quantum state is in a superposition of two locations, where it can seem to be in two places at the same time, once it is measured, it will randomly appear either ”here” or “there”, but not both. We only ever see the classical shadows cast by this strange quantum world. 
A growing number of experiments are implementing machine learning (ML) algorithms to aid in analyzing data, but these have the same limitations as the people they a…]]></summary>

Over four billion people live in cities around the globe, and while most people interact daily with others — at the grocery store, on public transit, at work — they may take for granted their frequent interactions with the diverse plants and animals that comprise fragile urban ecosystems. Trees in cities, called urban forests, provide critical benefits for public health and wellbeing and will prove integral to urban climate adaptation. They filter air and water, capture stormwater runoff, sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, and limit erosion and drought. Shade from urban trees reduces energy-expensive cooling costs and mitigates urban heat islands. In the US alone, urban fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. 

And, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press!

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Laura Downs and Anthony Francis, Software Engineers, Robotics at Google  
Many recent advances in computer vision and robotics rely on deep learning, but training deep learning models requires a wide variety of data to generalize to new scenarios. Historically, deep learning for computer vision has relied on datasets with millions of items that were gathered by web scraping, examples of which include ImageNet, Open Images, YouTube-8M, and COCO. However, the process of creating these datasets can be labor-intensive, and can still exhibit labeling errors that can distort the perception of progress. Furthermore, this strategy does not readily generalize to arbitrary three-dimensional shapes or real-world robotic data.

Sparse models stand out among the most promising approaches for the future of deep learning. Instead of every part of a model processing every input (“dense” modeling), sparse models employing conditional computation learn to route individual inputs to different “experts” in a potentially huge network. This has many benefits. First, model size can increase while keeping computational cost constant — an effective and environmentally friendlier way to scale models, which is often key to high performance. Sparsity also naturally compartmentalizes neural networks. Dense models that learn many different tasks simultaneously (multitask) or sequentially (continual learning) of…]]></summary>
