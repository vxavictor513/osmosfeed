        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of the team and everyone who contributed, I am pleased to announce that the first milestone release of Spring Batch 5.0 is available now from https://repo.spring.io/milestone. This first milestone includes a number of major changes such as requiring Java 17+, migrating to Jakarta EE 9 APIs as well as upgrading our dependencies across the portfolio to major versions such as Spring Framework 6.0. For a complete list of changes, please check the change log.

We also took the opportunity of this major version to remove deprecated APIs and fix some issues that require non backward compatible changes. The migration guide contains more details about these changes and provides the upgrade instructions.

As we continue our work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on this first milestone!

Elastic Security has verified a new destructive malware targeting Ukraine: Operation Bleeding Bear.
Over the weekend, Microsoft released details about this multi-stage and destructive malware campaign that the Ukrainian National Cyber Security Coordination Center has been referring to as Operation Bleeding Bear. 
Elastic users are fully protected from attacks like these through our advanced malware detection and Ransomware Protection capabilities, and the Elastic Security team continues to monitor these events. This case highlights the importance of prevention when it’s up against ransomware and malware with destructive capabilities.
In this full-length article, we break down the involved malware providing new insights and highlighting behaviors that can be used to help identify this activity.
Elastic Security researchers provide an overview of Operation Bleeding Bear, including how it wipes the Master Boot Record, uses tampering techniques such as disabling Windows Defender, leverages process hollowing, and corrupts files across the file system. We also outline defensive recommendations, specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and a how-to-locate and remediate guide using Elastic Security and the MITRE ATT&CK® framework — identifying malware components at each stage. 
Existing Elastic Security users can access these capabilities within the product. If you’re new to Elastic Security, take a look at our Quick Start guides (bite-sized training videos to get you started quickly). And you can always get started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud.]]></summary>

For three months, lava ran out of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, pouring into the Atlantic Ocean surrounding the Canary Islands. 
The eruption destroyed more than 3,000 homes in a torrent of fire and liquid rock and caused untold impact on the islands’ fragile ecosystem and economy. Mercifully, only one death has been linked to this devastating event.

Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another —  is often a mystery. Explaining a neural model’s decision process may have high social impact in certain areas, such as analysis of medical images and autonomous driving, where human oversight is critical. These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I am pleased to announce that Spring REST Docs 3.0.0-M1 is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

This initial 3.0 milestone contains 13 enhancements, documentation improvements, and dependency upgrades. It covers the baseline upgrade efforts, in particular requiring JDK 17 and Spring Framework 6 and migrating to the Jakarta EE 9 APIs as announced in this blog post.

Please note that support for REST Assured has been removed temporarily as it is not yet compatible with Jakarta EE 9. We hope to reinstate support in a subsequent milestone prior to 3.0’s release towards the end of this year.

Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements in natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost incre…]]></summary>

While nearly one in five companies say they are releasing code 10 times faster than in the past, more software means more security flaws, and greater opportunity for bad actors to take advantage of them. 
The faster pace and increasing risks highlight the need for IT leaders to get serious about embracing DevSecOps, a management approach that makes security a shared responsibility among development, security, and IT operations teams. One indication that DevSecOps is gaining traction in the enterprise: Nearly half of development teams used application security tools in 2020, compared to just under 30% in 2015, according to 451 Research, part of S&P Global Market Intelligence.

The rise of “Open Banking” has enabled banking customers to choose to share their previously inaccessible, locked down data with all sorts of third parties — from budgeting apps to mobile wallets, to peer to peer payment providers. This revolution has been a welcome boon for banks, customers, and financial services innovators alike. The ability to securely share access and permissions to accounts has fueled the rise and growth of an entire new industry — FinTech —  as retail and institutional customers finally have the power of choice. The result has been the creation of an ever-growing ecosystem of new players constructing applications, modernizing infrastructure, and accelerating the pace of change.

You might now ask why is there a new release in the calver 2021.x version and why is there already a 2022.x release?

In parallel to working on Spring Data 3.x, aka 2022.0.0, we continue to invest in the support of the Spring Data 2.x development line. We already expect Spring Data 2.7 and 2.8 releases. So, if you want to continue using Spring Boot 2 for an extended period of time, stick to the 2021.x release trains (which are based on Spring Framework 5.3 and Java 8). That’s the reason we chose to continue with calver 2021.x, which, hopefully, makes understanding version compatibilities easie…]]></summary>

Overview
Following the discovery of Log4Shell, a vulnerability in Log4J2, Elastic released a blog post describing how users of our platform can leverage Elastic Security to help defend their networks. We also released an advisory detailing how Elastic products and users are impacted.
In this blog, we expand on these initial posts and highlight how the combination of security and observability solutions can provide deep visibility into the exploited vulnerability and arm security analysts with valuable data for root cause analysis.
Gaining the upper hand - combining Observability and Security data
Along with Elastic Security, we provide a comprehensive Observability suite within Kibana. Observability is primarily referring to the combination of application performance monitoring (APM), lo…]]></summary>

Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil…]]></summary>

That evening, at a welcome reception with executives all in casual attire, a male colleague arrived wearing a black skirt and combat boots.

As the years of my Elastic journey progressed, kindness, empathy and understanding for all employees has permeated the culture via emails, corporate policies and conversations.

The early stages of an intrusion usually include initial access, execution, persistence, and command-and-control (C2) beaconing. When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected. It can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary as we saw in the 2020 SUNBURST supply chain compromise. Could we then have detected SUNBURST in the initial hours or days by finding its C2 beacon?
The potential for beaconing detection is that it can serve as an early warning system and help discover novel persistence mechanisms in the initial hours or days after execution. This allows defenders to disrupt or evict the threat actor before they can achieve their objectives. So, while we are not quite "left of boom" b…]]></summary>

Over the last several decades, I've witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we'll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I’ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we’ll likely see in the next few years.
