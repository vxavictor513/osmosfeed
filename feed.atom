The rapid adoption of multicloud IT environments and the transition to hybrid workforces demand a new dynamic in the C-suite: a closer alliance between CIOs and CISOs. 

By joining forces, CIOs and CISOs can strike a healthy balance between pushing the pace of tech innovation and mitigating risk. Moving to the cloud — especially to more complex multicloud environments — can occur more quickly and efficiently. DevSecOps teams can reduce the risks of onboarding new software applications. With greater collaboration, CISOs and CIOs can jointly assess the operational challenges and security risks when bringing on new technologies.

However, achieving all that requires the two executives to take on an agenda of shared goals. For example, CIOs must aspire to embed security into all new technolo…]]></summary>

In efforts to learn about the quantum world, scientists face a big obstacle: their classical experience of the world. Whenever a quantum system is measured, the act of this measurement destroys the “quantumness” of the state. For example, if the quantum state is in a superposition of two locations, where it can seem to be in two places at the same time, once it is measured, it will randomly appear either ”here” or “there”, but not both. We only ever see the classical shadows cast by this strange quantum world.

Over four billion people live in cities around the globe, and while most people interact daily with others — at the grocery store, on public transit, at work — they may take for granted their frequent interactions with the diverse plants and animals that comprise fragile urban ecosystems. Trees in cities, called urban forests, provide critical benefits for public health and wellbeing and will prove integral to urban climate adaptation. They filter air and water, capture stormwater runoff, sequester atmospheric carbon dioxide, and limit erosion and drought. Shade from urban trees reduces energy-expensive cooling costs and mitigates urban heat islands. In the US alone, urban fo…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? It’s been a hot minute since we last chatted. I was in Germany this time last week. Now, I’m back in beautiful San Francisco. Today the weather will climb to a monumental 84 F! That’s very unusual, for any time of the year, here in San Francisco. Most places here in San Francisco don’t have air conditioning. Some have heating. I bought a brand new condo in 2014 and it didn’t have air conditioning. You just open the window. I am privileged enough that I have air conditioning today, of course. I mention all this to say that it’s hot here! I worry for the elderly! When it gets this hot, the YMCA and other organizations typically invite elderly people to come in and get some cool air and water. It’s dangerous. Some days it gets even hotter. Very rare, but it does happen. I hope you’re all doing well. Take care of yourselves and each other, my friends. 

And, speaking of being hot, let’s look at this week’s roundup of the latest-and-greatest that’s hot off the press!

Employee resource groups, or as we like to call them, Elastician resource groups, have been an informal part of Elastic’s culture since 2016. They started as Slack channels and were formalized in 2021 to ensure that the members would have structure, budget, and ultimately, a voice based on any dimension of diversity, identity, allyship, and advocacy. This was an important step in our global diversity, equity, and inclusion strategy.

Our ERGs are aligned to shared identities, interests, affinities, or allyships. The goal is to create a community of people with something in common and to encourage sharing, learning, and networking.

We have all had to embrace change as a result of the pandemic, be smarter about our online activities due to increased cyber crime, and stay informed geo-politically in light of recent events in Ukraine. We are not, however, on the front lines like public sector leaders and teams. Many of us do not realise just how quickly the public sector needs to move to respond to factors like these in order to sustain our way of life in a changing world. And the key to public sector agility? Connecting people with data.

This theme was made clear at a recent ElasticON Public Sector event in London, where UK public sector leaders, including Gav Smith, Director General for Technology & SRO for National Security Data, GCHQ, shared how their organisations have “become a product of their data, and a prod…]]></summary>

Just as companies discovered the value of cloud storage in recent years, many are starting to benefit from managing multiple cloud systems. Already, more than three-fourths of enterprise organizations use two cloud systems, and roughly a quarter have implemented three or more.

CIOs are leaning into multicloud frameworks for a variety of reasons, such as managing software designed for specific cloud environments, ensuring better system reliability, or streamlining a collection of technology infrastructures inherited through acquisition. Experts say adoption rates will continue to climb for important reasons: The cloud makes enterprise data available anytime and from anywhere and promises sophisticated analytics and top-notch security — without the costs of running or maintaining data cen…]]></summary>

There are many ways developers can host search applications built with Elastic, ranging from plugging into existing Kubernetes orchestrations to downloading and running the solutions in their own infrastructure. Ultimately, the choice is yours on how you want to manage these solutions. So, how can you ensure you choose the right hosting method? 

Across the board, the best — and easiest — decision is to go with the cloud. Elastic Cloud’s fully managed experience is the optimal way to build highly scalable and performant search solutions using Elastic’s products across any cloud provider. With Elastic Cloud, you can rapidly deploy in your favorite public cloud, or in multiple clouds, and extend the value of Elastic with cloud-native features.

Challenges with healthcare data  
Healthcare data makes up a third of the world’s data and is projected to grow, in the next few years, at a faster pace than traditional data-rich industries like financial services and manufacturing.* The staggering data volumes in healthcare, in addition to its heterogeneity and fragmentation, represent substantial challenges to extracting data insights for improving healthcare outcomes of individuals and communities. 

At Anthem, Inc., we have undertaken various initiatives to address these challenges — most notably full-text search of healthcare claims.

In this post, we share with you our automated deployment solution for ELK stack. This deployment pattern is in use internally at Anthem to power real-time search capabilities on top of Anthem’s health…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Laura Downs and Anthony Francis, Software Engineers, Robotics at Google  
Many recent advances in computer vision and robotics rely on deep learning, but training deep learning models requires a wide variety of data to generalize to new scenarios. Historically, deep learning for computer vision has relied on datasets with millions of items that were gathered by web scraping, examples of which include ImageNet, Open Images, YouTube-8M, and COCO. However, the process of creating these datasets can be labor-intensive, and can still exhibit labeling errors that can distort the perception of progress. Furthermore, this strategy does not readily generalize to arbitrary three-dimensional shapes or real-world robotic data.

Shortly after, Christian Dupuis joined, led the project for many years and initiated the Spring Tool Suite on top of Spring IDE.

As financial institutions migrate to modern infrastructure and cloud services, bad actors have extended their skills and capabilities to achieve their missions. This is compounded by the fact that financial and payment vehicles continue to go virtual. Even the slightest breach can result in fines and reputational harm. 

Many financial institutions are successfully taking a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, according to our recent co-sponsored study with ThoughtLab. Cybersecurity Solutions for a Riskier World reports that 91% of financial services companies are either “mid-implementation” or “advanced” in maturity against the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework.

It provides an in-depth look at all things Spring for GraphQL.

This week I’m publishing two new installments. 

In this week’s first installment, episode three of a series, looks at batching requests with Spring for GraphQL’s @BatchMapping support. This mechanism in turn builds on Facebook’s DataLoader facility. 


Then, in this week’s second installment, episode four of a series, we look at how to make a change with mutations. This is one of my favorite parts about GraphQL - it’s plain, pragmatic, and - most importantly - obvious! 


This continues the series we started last week, with episodes one and two, which I recap here: 

In this first installment, we look at the basics of using the GraphQL Java engine that underpins Spring for GraphQL. 


In this second installment, we look at using the Spring for GraphQL component model by writing queries. 


I know it’s been more than a month since we last published a video, so I’m going to be releasing every episode of this series very quickly, over the next week or two. I’ve already recorded and mostly finished producing eight episodes. I’m working on producing a ninth, and that’ll be that! A complete introduction to all things Spring for GraphQL. These are of course part of the usual Spring Tips playlist on YouTube, but also part of the Learn Spring for GraphQL with Josh Long playlist.

Sparse models stand out among the most promising approaches for the future of deep learning. Instead of every part of a model processing every input (“dense” modeling), sparse models employing conditional computation learn to route individual inputs to different “experts” in a potentially huge network. This has many benefits. First, model size can increase while keeping computational cost constant — an effective and environmentally friendlier way to scale models, which is often key to high performance. Sparsity also naturally compartmentalizes neural networks. Dense models that learn many different tasks simultaneously (multitask) or sequentially (continual learning) of…]]></summary>
