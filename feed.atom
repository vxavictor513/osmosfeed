I’m doing great. I’m in sunny Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, eating delicious food and hanging out with amazing people. Tomorrow, I’m off to Penang, Malaysia, for a little tourism before I get back to a more code-driven kinda fun: I’ll be doing a developer event looking at the latest-and-greatest from Spring Boot 3 here in Kuala Lumpur on the 11th of November - ten short days from now! - so please join me!

Also, I just joined Mastodon - a decentralized and open-source Twitter; I’m not leaving Twitter, of course, but I would love to make new friends and grow the community there: @starbuxman@mastodon.online! 

Anyway, my friends, housekeeping aside, we’ve got a ton of amazing things to talk about today so let’s dive right into it!

Users can much more quickly and easily create and manage tasks like identifying user sentiment in support requests, utilizing named-entity recognition (NER) at query time to filter search results, answering questions programmatically with vector similarity, and preparing data for analysis by reducing whitespace. All of this happens with a few clicks in the Enterprise Search UI, no complexity required.
Thanks to Elastic’s n…]]></summary>

A few months back, we introduced the beta release of Elastic APM .NET agent profiler auto-instrumentation. Fast forward to today, we're excited to announce the general availability (GA) of this powerful capability that allows the .NET APM agent to automatically instrument .NET Framework, .NET Core, and .NET applications without requiring code changes or recompilation. In addition, assemblies for common messaging frameworks like Kafka and RabbitMQ, as well as MySQL, Oracle, and PostgreSQL, can now be automatically instrumented.
At the time of the beta release, we posted a detailed technical blog about how auto-instrumentation works in the next iteration of the Elastic APM .NET Agent. This blog contains a deep-dive into profiling — including COM Interfaces and Method rewriting — and includ…]]></summary>

Impact



Users who have applied the mitigation should take note of the following impact:



No authorized scopes are mapped to the principal (current user) when the Authorization Server (AS) responds to the OAuth2 Access Token Response with an empty or missing scope parameter.



If you are affected by this vulnerability, users will not be granted any authorities beginning with SCOPE_ when the AS does not return scopes. Only the special authority ROLE_USER is given to the principal.

Beginning with 6.0, the special authority is ch…]]></summary>

To many people, free software (including open source) usually means no cost. Similarly, in-house developers often use free software to create tools that help streamline or automate processes, thereby removing the need to purchase software. 

Not only can IT leaders save money by using no-cost software and homegrown developer tools, but they can also bypass the red tape involved with executive buy-in and budget approval. Sounds good, right?

Not so fast. For small businesses on a shoestring budget, free software — for example, accounting, photo editing, task tracking apps — can make a lot of sense. However, when it comes to enterprise companies running mission-critical applications, there’s a time and place for trialing “free” software and building your own quick-fix solutions in-house, a…]]></summary>

Open Images is a computer vision dataset covering ~9 million images with labels spanning thousands of object categories. Researchers around the world use Open Images to train and evaluate computer vision models. Since the initial release of Open Images in 2016, which included image-level labels covering 6k categories, we have provided multiple updates to enrich annotations and expand the potential use cases of the dataset. Through several releases, we have added image-level labels for over 20k categories on all images and bounding box annotations, visual relations, instance segmentations, and localized narratives (synchronized voice, mouse trace, and text caption) on a subset of 1.9M images.

        <link href="https://spring.io/blog/2022/10/25/spring-integration-6-0-0-rc1-available"/>
        <updated>2022-10-25T13:55:35.000Z</updated>
        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Dear Spring community,



I was so eager to find and fix bugs in the latest Spring Integration release, that missed to announce a 6.0 RC1 last week.
But I believe it is still worth to mention it even after Spring Boot 3.0.0-RC1 announcement since there is a number of notable changes and improvements.



So, please, welcome Spring Integration 6.0 first Release Candidate.
It can be obtained from Spring Milestone repository:




dependencyManagement {
    imports {
        mavenBom 'org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-bom:6.0.0-RC1'
    }
}




Here you can find important changes after the previously announced Spring Integration 6.0.0-M5:





spring-integration-amqp has added support for RabbitMQ Streams;



spring-integration-sftp has been migrated from an old unsupported jsch library to more modern Apache MINA;



spring-integration-gemfire was removed according to dropped support for Apache Geode in Spring Data;



spring-integration-scripting has added a GraalVM Polyglot support for JavaScript invocations;



The Apache Groovy DSL for Spring Integration extension project has been migrated to the spring-integration-groovy module code base;



The Spring Integration for Apache Cassandra extension project has been migrated as a spring-integration-cassandra module;



The Kotlin Coroutines support has been added to the @ServiceActivator POJO functions, also messaging gateway methods can now be as suspended functions;



The AOP ChannelSecurityInterceptor in the spring-integration-security module has been deprecated in favor of AuthorizationChannelInterceptor.





Also, see a Migration Guide for breaking changes in the framework and its modules.



It would be great if you give it a chance and come back to us with reports, so it may make it into GA next month.



See you in person this December at SpringOne!



Cheers, 

Artem

Microservice-based systems have become ubiquitous in the last couple of years. However, the idea of monolithic, modular systems has also regained popularity recently.
Independent of the architectural style ultimately selected, the individual applications comprising the overall system need their structure to be evolvable and able to follow changes in business requirements.



Traditionally, application frameworks have provided structural guidance by providing abstractions aligned with technical concepts, such as Spring Framework’s stereotype annotations (@Controller, @Service, @Repository, and so on).

Evolution strategy (ES) is a family of optimization techniques inspired by the ideas of natural selection: a population of candidate solutions are usually evolved over generations to better adapt to an optimization objective. ES has been applied to a variety of challenging decision making problems, such as legged locomotion, quadcopter control, and even power system control.  

Compared to gradient-based reinforcement learning (RL) methods like proximal policy optimization (PPO) and soft actor-critic (SAC), ES has several advantages.

Understanding the aesthetic and technical quality of images is important for providing a better user visual experience. Image quality assessment (IQA) uses models to build a bridge between an image and a user's subjective perception of its quality. In the deep learning era, many IQA approaches, such as NIMA, have achieved success by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs). However, CNN-based IQA models are often constrained by the fixed-size input requirement in batch training, i.e., the input images need to be resized or cropped to a fixed size shape. This preprocessing is problematic for IQA because images can have very different aspect ratios and resolutions…]]></summary>

But, be assured that Elastic RUM is equally wonderful! Let’s take a sip! I do want to warn you that it will take a bit of time to go through the amount of detail I will cover in this blog.
What is RUM?
Elastic real user monitoring, or RUM, captures user interactions with the web browser and provides a detailed view of the “real user experience” of your web applications from a performance perspective. Elastic’s RUM Agent is a JavaScript Agent, which means it supports any JavaScript-based application. RUM can provide valuable insight into your applications. Some of the common benefits of RUM include:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[It is finally here! The first release candidate of Spring Batch 5 is now available from our milestone repository. In this release, we worked on the following items:


  
Execution context Meta-data improvement

  
GemFire support removal


This blog post walks through these two changes in details. For the complete list of changes, please check the release notes.
Execution context Meta-data improvement

In addition to what Spring Batch already persists in the execution context with regard to runtime information (like the step type, the restart flag, etc), this release adds an important detail in the execution context which is the Spring Batch version that was used to serialize the context.

While this seems a detail, it has a huge added value when debugging upgrade issues with regard to execution context serialization and deserialization.
GemFire support removal

Based on the decision to discontinue the support of Spring Data for Apache Geode, the support for Apache Geode in Spring Batch was removed.

The code was moved to the spring-batch-extensions repository as a community-driven effort.
What’s next?

We are planning to roll out a second release candidate early November and release 5.0.0 GA by the end of November, in time for Spring Boot 3.0.0. We would appreciate your help to try this release candidate out and share your feedback with us on Github, Twitter and StackOverflow. You can find a migration guide here.

I would like to thank all contributors who had a role in this first release candidate!

Server-side apply (SSA) has now
been GA for a few releases, and I
have found myself in a number of conversations, recommending that people / teams
in various situations use it. So I’d like to write down some of those reasons.
Obvious (and not-so-obvious) benefits of SSA
A list of improvements / niceties you get from switching from various things to
Server-side apply!
Versus client-side-apply (that is, plain kubectl apply):

The system gives you conflicts when you accidentally fight with another
actor over the value of a field!
When combined with --dry-run, there’s no chance of accidentally running a
client-side dry run instead of a server side dry run.
Versus hand-rolling patches:

The SSA patch format is extremely natural to write, with no weird syntax.

The task of determining the similarity between images is an open problem in computer vision and is crucial for evaluating the realism of machine-generated images. Though there are a number of straightforward methods of estimating image similarity (e.g., low-level metrics that measure pixel differences, such as FSIM and SSIM), in many cases, the measured similarity differences do not match the differences perceived by a person. However, more recent work has demonstrated that intermediate representations of neural network classifiers, such as AlexNet, VGG and SqueezeNet trained on ImageNet, exhibit perceptual similarity as an emergent property. That is, Euclidean distances between encoded rep…]]></summary>

Robot learning has been applied to a wide range of challenging real world tasks, including dexterous manipulation, legged locomotion, and grasping. It is less common to see robot learning applied to dynamic, high-acceleration tasks requiring tight-loop human-robot interactions, such as table tennis. There are two complementary properties of the table tennis task that make it interesting for robotic learning research. First, the task requires both speed and precision, which puts significant demands on a learning algorithm. At the same time, the problem is highly-structured (with a fixed, predictable environment) and naturally multi-agent (the robot can play with humans or another robot), makin…]]></summary>

Through this process, organizations collect and analyze data, and determine if a program is performing as expected within set boundaries. When combined with alerting, monitoring allows for detecting unexpected system behavior to mitigate exceptional situations as fast as possible. Furthermore, tracking the performance of a system enables organizations to improve those aspects that have the biggest impact with higher priority. One essential aspect of monitoring is the list of key metrics you want to observe. There are different categories of statistics that can be of interest here. To observe the defined metrics, there are plenty of application monitoring tools on the market today. They differ in many aspects...

Building models that understand and generate natural language well is one the grand goals of machine learning (ML) research and has a direct impact on building smart systems for everyday applications. Improving the quality of language models is a key target for researchers to make progress toward such a goal.   

Most common paradigms to build and train language models use either autoregressive decoder-only architectures (e.g., PaLM or GPT-3), where the model is trained to predict the next word for a given prefix phrase, or span corruption-based encoder-decoder architectures (e.g., T5, ST-MoE), where the training objective is to recover the subset of words masked out of the input. On the one hand, T5-li…]]></summary>

Image captioning is the machine learning task of automatically generating a fluent natural language description for a given image. This task is important for improving accessibility for visually impaired users and is a core task in multimodal research encompassing both vision and language modeling.  
 
However, datasets for image captioning are primarily available in English. Beyond that, there are only a few datasets covering a limited number of languages that represent just a small fraction of the world’s population. Further, these datasets feature images that severely under-represent the richness and diversity of cultures from across the globe. These aspects have hindered research on…]]></summary>

Generating realistic audio requires modeling information represented at different scales. For example, just as music builds complex musical phrases from individual notes, speech combines temporally local structures, such as phonemes or syllables, into words and sentences. Creating well-structured and coherent audio sequences at all these scales is a challenge that has been addressed by coupling audio with transcriptions that can guide the generative process, be it text transcripts for speech synthesis or MIDI representations for piano. However, this approach breaks when trying to model untranscribed aspects of audio, such as speaker characteristics necessary to help people with spee…]]></summary>

We expect the brand new Third Party Security Audit of Kubernetes will be
published later this month (Oct 2022).
In preparation for that, let's look at the state of findings that were made
public as part of the last third party security audit of
2019
that was based on Kubernetes v1.13.4.
Motivation
Craig Ingram has graciously attempted over the years to keep track of the
status of the findings reported in the last audit in this issue:
kubernetes/kubernetes#81146.
This blog post will attempt to dive deeper into this, address any gaps
in tracking and become a point in time summary of the state of the
findings reported from 2019.

Frame interpolation is the process of synthesizing in-between images from a given set of images. The technique is often used for temporal up-sampling to increase the refresh rate of videos or to create slow motion effects. Nowadays, with digital cameras and smartphones, we often take several photos within a few seconds to capture the best picture. Interpolating between these “near-duplicate” photos can lead to engaging videos that reveal scene motion, often delivering an even more pleasing sense of the moment than the original photos.  
  
Frame interpolation between consecutive video frames, which often have small motion, has been studied extensively. Unlike videos, however, the temporal spacing between near-duplicate photos can …]]></summary>

Whether on-premises or in the cloud, clusters face real constraints for resource usage, quota, and cost management reasons. Regardless of the autoscalling capabilities, clusters have finite capacity. As a result, users want an easy way to fairly and
efficiently share resources.
In this article, we introduce Kueue,
an open source job queueing controller designed to manage batch jobs as a single unit.
Kueue leaves pod-level orchestration to existing stable components of Kubernetes.
Kueue natively supports the Kubernetes Job
API and offers hooks for integrating other custom-built APIs for batch jobs.
Why Kueue?
Job queueing is a key feature to run batch workloads at scale in both on-premises and cloud environments. The main goal…]]></summary>
