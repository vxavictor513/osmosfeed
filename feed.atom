        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The financial ecosystem is experiencing an exciting evolution in global payment systems, driven by a digital first approach. The pandemic changed both consumer and business behavior toward adopting new and emerging forms of digital channels. The increased use of digital wallets, real-time payments, embedded payments (such as ApplePay and GooglePay), peer to peer payment systems, and other emerging vehicles ramped up. In fact, according to statista.com, digital payments are projected to reach $11.55 trillion in transaction value within 2024 — all while cash as a form of payment continues to decrease globally.
While this revolution has greatly improved efficiency and reduced friction for customers, banks, and merchants, it has also resulted in an exponential growth in fraud in financial serv…]]></summary>

How? OpenSearch is a forked search project based on old versions (7.10) of Elasticsearch and Kibana®. Through comprehensive tests, TechTarget's Enterprise Strategy Group validated that Elasticsearch outperforms OpenSearch across key performance indicators and resource utilization. Based on this technical validation, Elastic® developed a complementary report to provide a framework for buyers to understand the financial value their organization can reap when migrating from Opensearch to Elasticsearch for search and logging.

Whether it is improving resource optimization, faster performance, IT efficiency, or license cost savings, the Elasticsearch Service Enterprise license tier has much more to offer than the OpenSearch Service.

An astounding number of videos are available on the Web, covering a variety of content from everyday moments people share to historical moments to scientific observations, each of which contains a unique record of the world. The right tools could help researchers analyze these videos, transforming how we understand the world around us.

 

Videos offer dynamic visual content far more rich than static images, capturing movement, changes, and dynamic relationships between entities. Analyzing this complexity, along with the immense diversity of publicly available video data, demands models that go beyond traditional image understanding. Consequently, many of the approaches that be…]]></summary>

how anyone can join in to take advantage of a community-based learning experience.

could you tell us a bit about yourself?
Carlos Santana (CS): Of course. My experience in deploying Kubernetes in production six

Language models (LMs) trained to predict the next word given input text are the key technology for many applications [1, 2]. In Gboard, LMs are used to improve users’ typing experience by supporting features like next word prediction (NWP), Smart Compose, smart completion and suggestion, slide to type, and proofread. Deploying models on users’ devices rather than enterprise servers has advantages like lower latency and better privacy for model usage. While training on-device models directly from user data effectively improves the utility performance for applications such as NWP and smart text selection, protecting the privacy of user data for model training is important.

Conversational generative AI leapt into the public consciousness over the past year, and organizations scrambled to define their strategy for capitalizing on the trend. AI-boosted relevance is reshaping the way users experience search — and elevating their expectations for the quality of the interaction. 
In a recent discussion with product and engineering leaders from Adobe, Hugging Face, You.com, and Elastic, we assessed the current state of search and weighed in on these AI-fueled trends. Here are a few key themes they see on the horizon for all things AI in 2024:

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Our journey of improving performance is not complete without diving into the path events follow toward their destination. When Filebeat or any other beat is publishing events to a remote Elasticsearch®, it relies on its _bulk API. This means that Beats doesn’t only make requests to Elasticsearch, but it also parses its responses, which increases the memory utilization as a result. 

Previously, we showed how we managed to reduce Beats allocation by reducing the use of Logger in the event’s hot path, which reduced the overall allocated memory.

In this post, we will dive into the path of the publishing method and discuss how we managed to improve the memory allocation, which results in a direct increase of speed.

In simple terms, an AI search algorithm is the decision-making formula an AI tool uses to find the optimal solution to your specific problem. Search algorithms may make trade-offs between speed, relevance, or another weighted factor. It takes into account the query’s constraints and goals and presents back what it has calculated to be the best solution.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Christine Weng began her career in accounting — tax accounting to be exact. But during her first year in a full-time accounting role she realized she was more interested in the technology side of things.
“Ever since I started actually working, I realized I enjoyed automations, problem solving, and process development,” Christine says.
She took the time to explore her options by working with a group at her company that did tech consulting, but was still focused on accounting.
“Exploring isn’t a bad thing,” Christine says. “If you try something and you don’t like it then, at least you know.”
Christine’s interests stem from pain points in her previous job, she says. The tools she was working with didn’t have certain features and there weren't the resources to fix that.

The constantly changing nature of the world around us poses a significant challenge for the development of AI models. Often, models are trained on longitudinal data with the hope that the training data used will accurately represent inputs the model may receive in the future. More generally, the default assumption that all training data are equally relevant often breaks in practice. For example, the figure below shows images from the CLEAR nonstationary learning benchmark, and it illustrates how visual features of objects evolve significantly over a 10 year span (a phenomenon we refer to as slow concept drift), posing a challenge for object categorization models.

Differential privacy (DP) is a property of randomized mechanisms that limit the influence of any individual user’s information while processing and analyzing data. DP offers a robust solution to address growing concerns about data protection, enabling technologies across industries and government applications (e.g., the US census) without compromising individual user identities.  As its adoption increases, it’s important to identify the potential risks of developing mechanisms with faulty implementations. Researchers have recently found errors in the mathematical proofs of private mechanisms, and their implementations. For example, researchers compared six sparse vector technique (SVT) variations and found that only two…]]></summary>

Objects and their relationships are ubiquitous in the world around us, and relationships can be as important to understanding an object as its own attributes viewed in isolation — take for example transportation networks, production networks, knowledge graphs, or social networks. Discrete mathematics and computer science have a long history of formalizing such networks as graphs, consisting of nodes connected by edges in various irregular ways. Yet most machine learning (ML) algorithms allow only for regular and uniform relations between input objects, such as a grid of pixels, a sequence of words, or no relation at all.

Time-series forecasting is ubiquitous in various domains, such as retail, finance, manufacturing, healthcare and natural sciences. In retail use cases, for example, it has been observed that improving demand forecasting accuracy can meaningfully reduce inventory costs and increase revenue. Deep learning (DL) models have emerged as a popular approach for forecasting rich, multivariate, time-series data because they have proven to perform well in a variety of settings (e.g., DL models performed well in the M5 competition).



At the same time, there has been rapid progress in large foundation language models used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks, such as translation, retrieval-augmented generation, and code completion. Thes…]]></summary>

Machine learning models in the real world are often trained on limited data that may contain unintended statistical biases. For example, in the CELEBA celebrity image dataset, a disproportionate number of female celebrities have blond hair, leading to classifiers incorrectly predicting “blond” as the hair color for most female faces — here, gender is a spurious feature for predicting hair color. Such unfair biases could have significant consequences in critical applications such as medical diagnosis. 





Surprisingly, recent work has also discovered an inherent tendency of deep networks to amplify such statistical biases, through the so-called simplicity bias of deep learning. T…]]></summary>

Text-to-image diffusion models have shown exceptional capabilities in generating high-quality images from text prompts. However, leading models feature billions of parameters and are consequently expensive to run, requiring powerful desktops or servers (e.g., Stable Diffusion, DALL·E, and Imagen). While recent advancements in inference solutions on Android via MediaPipe and iOS via Core ML have been made in the past year, rapid (sub-second) text-to-image generation on mobile devices has remained out of reach.
 

To that end, in “MobileDiffusion: Subsecond Text-to-Image Generation on Mobile Devices”, we introduce a novel approach with the potential for rapid text-to-image generation on…]]></summary>
