Enterprise software development and operations has become an interesting space. We have some incredibly powerful tools at our disposal, yet as an industry, we have failed to adopt many of these tools that can make our lives easier. One such tool that is currently underutilized is application performance monitoring (APM) and tracing, despite the fact that OpenTelemetry has made it possible to adopt at low friction. 

Logging, however, is ubiquitous. Every software application has logs of some kind, and the default workflow for troubleshooting (even today) is to go from exceptions experienced by customers and systems to the logs and start from there to find a solution.

Creating robots that exhibit robust and dynamic locomotion capabilities, similar to animals or humans, has been a long-standing goal in the robotics community. In addition to completing tasks quickly and efficiently, agility allows legged robots to move through complex environments that are otherwise difficult to traverse. Researchers at Google have been pursuing agility for multiple years and across various form factors. Yet, while researchers have enabled robots to hike or jump over some obstacles, there is still no generally accepted benchmark that comprehensively measures robot agility or mobility.

Clustering is a central problem in unsupervised machine learning (ML) with many applications across domains in both industry and academic research more broadly. At its core, clustering consists of the following problem: given a set of data elements, the goal is to partition the data elements into groups such that similar objects are in the same group, while dissimilar objects are in different groups. This problem has been studied in math, computer science, operations research and statistics for more than 60 years in its myriad variants. Two common forms of clustering are metric clustering, in which the elements are points in a metric space, like in the k-means problem, and grap…]]></summary>

As more organizations leverage the Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud platform and services to drive operational efficiency and bring products to market, managing logs becomes a critical component of maintaining visibility and safeguarding multi-account AWS environments. Traditionally, logs are stored in Amazon Simple Storage Service (Amazon S3) and then shipped to an external monitoring and analysis solution for further processing.

To simplify this process and reduce management overhead, AWS users can now leverage the new Amazon Kinesis Firehose Delivery Stream to ingest logs into Elastic Cloud in AWS in real time and view them in the Elastic Stack alongside other logs for centralized analytics.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) makes managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles within Kubernetes easier than ever. It allows cluster
administrators to define the profiles in a predefined custom resource YAML,
which then gets distributed by the SPO into the whole cluster. Modification and
removal of the security profiles are managed by the operator in the same way,
but that’s a small subset of its capabilities.
Another core feature of the SPO is being able to stack seccomp profiles. This
means that users can define a baseProfileName in the YAML specification, which
then gets automatically resolved by the operator and combines the syscall rules.
If a base profile has another baseProfileName, then the operator will
recursively resolve the profiles up to a ce…]]></summary>

Code-change reviews are a critical part of the software development process at scale, taking a significant amount of the code authors’ and the code reviewers’ time. As part of this process, the reviewer inspects the proposed code and asks the author for code changes through comments written in natural language. At Google, we see millions of reviewer comments per year, and authors require an average of ~60 minutes active shepherding time between sending changes for review and finally submitting the change. In our measurements, the required active work time that the code author must do to address reviewer comments grows almost linearly with the number of comme…]]></summary>

Large machine learning (ML) models are ubiquitous in modern applications: from spam filters to recommender systems and virtual assistants. These models achieve remarkable performance partially due to the abundance of available training data. However, these data can sometimes contain private information, including personal identifiable information, copyright material, etc. Therefore, protecting the privacy of the training data is critical to practical, applied ML.  



Differential Privacy (DP) is one of the most widely accepted technologies that allows reasoning about data anonymization in a formal way. In the context of an ML model, DP can guarantee that each individual user's contribution will …]]></summary>

Video understanding is a challenging problem that requires reasoning about both spatial information (e.g., for objects in a scene, including their locations and relations) and temporal information for activities or events shown in a video. There are many video understanding applications and tasks, such as understanding the semantic content of web videos and robot perception. However, current works, such as ViViT and TimeSFormer, densely process the video and require significant compute, especially as model size plus video length and resolution increase.

The Security Profiles Operator (SPO) is a feature-rich
operator for Kubernetes to make managing seccomp, SELinux and
AppArmor profiles easier than ever. Recording those profiles from scratch is one
of the key features of this operator, which usually involves the integration
into large CI/CD systems. Being able to test the recording capabilities of the
operator in edge cases is one of the recent development efforts of the SPO and
makes it excitingly easy to play around with seccomp profiles.
Recording seccomp profiles with spoc record
The v0.8.0 release of the Security Profiles Operator shipped a new
command line interface called spoc, a little helper tool for recording and
replaying seccomp profiles among various other things that are out of scope of

As virtual assistants become ubiquitous, users increasingly interact with them to learn about new topics or obtain recommendations and expect them to deliver capabilities beyond narrow dialogues of one or two turns. Dynamic planning, namely the capability to look ahead and replan based on the flow of the conversation, is an essential ingredient for the making of engaging conversations with the deeper, open-ended interactions that users expect.
 

While large language models (LLMs) are now beating state-of-the-art approaches in many natural language processing benchmarks, they are typically trained to output the next best response, rather than planning ahead, which is required fo…]]></summary>

With Kubernetes 1.27, we (SIG Auth) are moving Key Management Service (KMS) v2 API to beta.
What is KMS?
One of the first things to consider when securing a Kubernetes cluster is encrypting etcd data at
rest. KMS provides an interface for a provider to utilize a key stored in an external key service to
perform this encryption.
KMS v1 has been a feature of Kubernetes since version 1.10, and is currently in beta as of version
v1.12. KMS v2 was introduced as alpha in v1.25.
Note
the previous blog post
was written and it is not compatible with the design in this blog post. Attempting to upgrade from
old versions with the alpha feature enabled will result in data loss.

There have recently been tremendous advances in language models, partly because they can perform tasks with strong performance via in-context learning (ICL), a process whereby models are prompted with a few examples of input-label pairs before performing the task on an unseen evaluation example. In general, models’ success at in-context learning is enabled by:
 


Their use of semantic prior knowledge from pre-training to predict labels while following the format of in-context examples (e.g., seeing examples of movie reviews with “positive sentiment” and “negative sentiment” as labels and performing sentiment analysis using prior knowledge).

Skin tone is an observable characteristic that is subjective, perceived differently by individuals (e.g., depending on their location or culture) and thus is complicated to annotate. That said, the ability to reliably and accurately annotate skin tone is highly important in computer vision. This became apparent in 2018, when the Gender Shades study highlighted that computer vision systems struggled to detect people with darker skin tones, and performed particularly poorly for women with darker skin tones. The study highlights the importance for computer researchers and practitioners to evaluate their technologies across the full range of skin tones and at intersections of…]]></summary>

How can Pod start-up be accelerated on nodes in large clusters? This is a common issue that
cluster administrators may face.
This blog post focuses on methods to speed up pod start-up from the kubelet side. It does not
involve the creation time of pods by controller-manager through kube-apiserver, nor does it
include scheduling time for pods or webhooks executed on it.
We have mentioned some important factors here to consider from the kubelet's perspective, but
this is not an exhaustive list. As Kubernetes v1.27 is released, this blog highlights
significant changes in v1.27 that aid in speeding up pod start-up.

Detection is a fundamental vision task that aims to localize and recognize objects in an image. However, the data collection process of manually annotating bounding boxes or instance masks is tedious and costly, which limits the modern detection vocabulary size to roughly 1,000 object classes. This is orders of magnitude smaller than the vocabulary people use to describe the visual world and leaves out many categories. Recent vision and language models (VLMs), such as CLIP, have demonstrated improved open-vocabulary visual recognition capabilities through learning from Internet-scale image-text pairs. These VLMs are applied to zero-shot classification using frozen model weights without the need for fine-…]]></summary>

In Kubernetes v1.27, we have added a new alpha feature that allows users

In Kubernetes, a Service can be used to provide a unified traffic endpoint for
applications running on a set of Pods. Clients can use the virtual IP address (or VIP) provided
by the Service for access, and Kubernetes provides load balancing for traffic accessing
different back-end Pods, but a ClusterIP type of Service is limited to providing access to
nodes within the cluster, while traffic from outside the cluster cannot be routed.
One way to solve this problem is to use a type: NodePort Service, which sets up a mapping
to a specific port of all nodes in the cluster, thus redirecting traffic from the
outside to the inside of the cluster.

Declarative configuration management with the kubectl apply command is the gold standard approach
to creating or modifying Kubernetes resources. However, one challenge it presents is the deletion
of resources that are no longer needed. In Kubernetes version 1.5, the --prune flag was
introduced to address this issue, allowing kubectl apply to automatically clean up previously
applied resources removed from the current configuration.
Unfortunately, that existing implementation of --prune has design flaws that diminish its
performance and can result in unexpected behaviors. The main issue stems from the lack of explicit
encoding of the previously applied set by the preceding apply operation, necessitating

Volume group snapshot is introduced as an Alpha feature in Kubernetes v1.27.
This feature introduces a Kubernetes API that allows users to take crash consistent
snapshots for multiple volumes together. It uses a label selector to group multiple
PersistentVolumeClaims for snapshotting.
This new feature is only supported for CSI volume drivers.
An overview of volume group snapshots
Some storage systems provide the ability to create a crash consistent snapshot of
multiple volumes. A group snapshot represents “copies” from multiple volumes that
are taken at the same point-in-time. A group snapshot can be used either to rehydrate
new volumes (pre-populated with the snapshot data) or to restore existing volumes to
a previous state (represented by the snapshots).

Kubernetes v1.27, released in April 2023, introduced changes to
Memory QoS (alpha) to improve memory management capabilites in Linux nodes.
Support for Memory QoS was initially added in Kubernetes v1.22, and later some
limitations
around the formula for calculating memory.high were identified. These limitations are
addressed in Kubernetes v1.27.
Background
Kubernetes allows you to optionally specify how much of each resources a container needs
in the Pod specification. The most common resources to specify are CPU and Memory.
For example, a Pod manifest that defines container resource requirements could look like:
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
name: example
spec:
containers:

memory: "64Mi"

Vision-language foundational models are built on the premise of a single pre-training followed by subsequent adaptation to multiple downstream tasks. Two main and disjoint training scenarios are popular: a CLIP-style contrastive learning and next-token prediction. Contrastive learning trains the model to predict if image-text pairs correctly match, effectively building visual and text representations for the corresponding image and text inputs, whereas next-token prediction predicts the most likely next text token in a sequence, thus learning to generate text, according to the required task. Contrastive learning enables image-text and text-image retrieval tasks, such as finding the image that best match…]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.27 graduated to beta a new policy mechanism for
StatefulSets that controls the lifetime of
their PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs). The new PVC
retention policy lets users specify if the PVCs generated from the StatefulSet spec template should
be automatically deleted or retrained when the StatefulSet is deleted or replicas in the StatefulSet
are scaled down.
What problem does this solve?
A StatefulSet spec can include Pod and PVC templates. When a replica is first created, the
Kubernetes control plane creates a PVC for that replica if one does not already exist. The behavior
before the PVC retention policy was that the control plane never cleaned up the PVCs created for
StatefulSets - this was left up to the cluster administrator, or to some add-on …]]></summary>

Teaching mobile robots to navigate in complex outdoor environments is critical to real-world applications, such as delivery or search and rescue. However, this is also a challenging problem as the robot needs to perceive its surroundings, and then explore to identify feasible paths towards the goal. Another common challenge is that the robot needs to overcome uneven terrains, such as stairs, curbs, or rockbed on a trail, while avoiding obstacles and pedestrians. In our prior work, we investigated the second challenge by teaching a quadruped robot to tackle challenging uneven obstacles and various outdoor terrains.

Kubernetes 1.20 introduced the ContainerResource type metric

In Kubernetes 1.27, this feature moves to beta and the corresponding feature gate (HPAContainerMetrics) gets enabled by default.
What is the ContainerResource type metric
The ContainerResource type metric allows us to configure the autoscaling based on resource usage of individual containers.
In the following example, the HPA controller scales the target
so that the average utilization of the cpu in the application container of all the pods is around 60%.
