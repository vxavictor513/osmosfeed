        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[The Spring Data CrudRepository has various methods that return multiple instances of the entity managed by the repository.
It does so by using Iterable and not List, as one might expect.
In many cases, that is of no consequence, since you typically want to iterate over the result anyway.
However, you might occasionally prefer a List. In these cases, Iterable is annoying.



I will write more about why that choice was made in the first place and how you can deal with it as long as you are on Spring Data 2.x. However, let me get the good news out first:



Repositories returning Lists



Spring Data 3.0.0-M2 now offers a ListCrudRepository,
which returns a List where CrudRepository returns an Iterable.

When a kid gets a Swiss Army knife, she can suddenly accomplish more tasks more quickly — from whittling a stick to mending clothes to any job requiring a plastic toothpick. Observability, one of the hottest trends in IT, gives a growing number of IT organizations a similar empowered feeling: an ability to improve their systems and applications in a multiplicity of ways.
Observability is a software layer that can be built into a company’s IT infrastructure to better understand the performance of its systems and applications, including ones running in the cloud. Observability tools gather data from a multiplicity of sources to generate insights that were not previously possible. As a result, IT teams can spend less time hunting for needles in digital haystacks when problems arise and can …]]></summary>

To assist with the transition to this new style of configuration, we have compiled a list of common use-cases and the suggested alternatives going forward.

In the examples below we follow best practice by using the Spring Security lambda DSL and the method HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests to define our authorization rules. If you are new to the lambda DSL you can read about it in this blog post. If you would like to learn more about why we choose to use HttpSecurity#authorizeHttpRequests you can check out the reference documentation.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[,
The Elastic Security Research team has identified new detection strategies to overcome the bypass methodologies used by adversaries to silently deploy malware onto an endpoint and elevate privileges without the end-user knowing. Malware often requires full administrative privileges on a machine to perform more impactful actions, such as adding an antivirus exclusion, encrypting secured files, or injecting code into system processes. Even if the targeted user has administrative privileges, the prevalence of User Account Control (UAC) means that the malicious application will often default to medium integrity, preventing write access to resources with higher integrity levels. Mandatory Integrity Levels (MIC) provides a mechanism for controlling access to securable objects.

In the world of networks, there are models that can explain observations across a diverse collection of applications. These include simple tasks such as computing the shortest path, which has obvious applications to routing networks but also applies in biology, e.g., where the slime mold Physarum is able to find shortest paths in mazes. Another example is Braess’s paradox — the observation that adding resources to a network can have an effect opposite to the one expected — which manifests not only in road networks but also in mechanical and electrical systems. For instance, constructing a new road can increase traffic congestion or adding a new link in an electrical circuit can increase voltage. Such connec…]]></summary>

  Mechanical ventilators provide critical support for patients who have difficulty breathing or are unable to breathe on their own. They see frequent use in scenarios ranging from routine anesthesia, to neonatal intensive care and life support during the COVID-19 pandemic. A typical ventilator consists of a compressed air source, valves to control the flow of air into and out of the lungs, and a "respiratory circuit" that connects the ventilator to the patient. In some cases, a sedated patient may be connected to the ventilator via a tube inserted through the trachea to their lungs, a process called invasive ventilation.

We’re pleased to share that Elastic and Amazon have resolved the trademark infringement lawsuit related to the term Elasticsearch. Now the only Elasticsearch service on AWS and the AWS Marketplace is Elastic Cloud. 
This resolution follows the change to the license of Elasticsearch and Kibana in 2021, and Amazon’s subsequent actions, including renaming their service. We believe this resolution will remove confusion in the marketplace and provide much-needed clarity to our community and customers.  
There is only one Elasticsearch, and it comes from Elastic. This means when you use Elasticsearch, whether as the Elastic Cloud service in AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud, or when you download and run Elasticsearch yourself, you can be sure that you’re getting the best possible experience because …]]></summary>

When we launched Azure Spring Cloud with VMware in 2019, we set out to solve common challenges developers, IT operators, and DevOps teams face when running Spring Boot applications at scale. Since then we’ve had the opportunity to work with many customers to help them adopt the service including Bosch, Digital Realty, Kroger, Liantis, Morgan Stanley, National Life, Raley’s, and Swiss Re. They value the fully managed infrastructure of Azure Spring Cloud that lets them focus on their apps, while the service manages dynamic scaling, security patching, out-of-the-box instrumentation for monitoring, and more.

Machine learning (ML) has become prominent in information technology, which has led some to raise concerns about the associated rise in the costs of computation, primarily the carbon footprint, i.e., total greenhouse gas emissions. While these assertions rightfully elevated the discussion around carbon emissions in ML, they also highlight the need for accurate data to assess true carbon footprint, which can help identify strategies to mitigate carbon emission in ML.
 
In “The Carbon Footprint of Machine Learning Training Will Plateau, Then Shrink”, accepted for publication in IEEE Computer, we focus on operational carbon emissions — i.e., the energy cost of operating ML hardware, including data center overhead…]]></summary>

In recent years, machine learning (ML) competitions in health have attracted ML scientists to work together to solve challenging clinical problems. These competitions provide access to relevant data and well-defined problems where experienced data scientists come to compete for solutions and learn new methods. However, a fundamental difficulty in organizing such challenges is obtaining and curating high quality datasets for model development and independent datasets for model evaluation.

Large pre-trained language models, which are continuing to grow in size, achieve state-of-art results on many natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks. Since the development of GPT and BERT, standard practice has been to fine-tune models on downstream tasks, which involves adjusting every weight in the network (i.e., model tuning). However, as models become larger, storing and serving a tuned copy of the model for each downstream task becomes impractical. 
 An appealing alternative is to share across all downstream tasks a single frozen pre-trained language model, in which all weights are fixed. In an exciting development, GPT-3 showed convincingly that a frozen model can be conditio…]]></summary>

Most developers believe that building reliable software involves writing good code, implementing enough testing, and using as many proven architecture patterns as possible. The assumption is that building things this way equals creating a flawless system. Sadly, in the software world, this is not true. Software reliability is not the same as software correctness. You may write good code, implement enough testing, and use as many proven architecture patterns as possible to end up with software deemed correct. But, the code may still blow up straight on the customer's face.

In visual understanding, the Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants have received significant attention recently due to their superior performance on many core visual applications, such as image classification, object detection, and video understanding. The core idea of ViT is to utilize the power of self-attention layers to learn global relationships between small patches of images. However, the number of connections between patches increases quadratically with image size. Such a design has been observed to be data inefficient — although the original ViT can perform better than convolutional networks with hundreds of millions of images for pre-training, such a data requirement is not always practical, and it sti…]]></summary>

People learn to do things by watching others — from mimicking new dance moves, to watching YouTube cooking videos. We’d like robots to do the same, i.e., to learn new skills by watching people do things during training. Today, however, the predominant paradigm for teaching robots is to remote control them using specialized hardware for teleoperation and then train them to imitate pre-recorded demonstrations. This limits both who can provide the demonstrations (programmers & roboticists) and where they can be provided (lab settings). If robots could instead self-learn new tasks by watching humans, this capability could allow them to be deployed in more unstructured settings like the home, and ma…]]></summary>

Continuing advances in the design and implementation of datacenter (DC) accelerators for machine learning (ML), such as TPUs and GPUs, have been critical for powering modern ML models and applications at scale. These improved accelerators exhibit peak performance (e.g., FLOPs) that is orders of magnitude better than traditional computing systems. However, there is a fast-widening gap between the available peak performance offered by state-of-the-art hardware and the actual achieved performance when ML models run on that hardware.  
 One approach to address this gap is to design hardware-specific ML models that optimize both performance (e.g., throughput and latency) and model quality. Recen…]]></summary>

We previously had a milestone M1, named 3.0.0-M1 which we soon after its release realised that it was a mistake to pump major version for this rework to make codebase better for Spring Boot 2.x. We want to avoid confusing versioning when spring-shell upgrades and baselines with Spring Boot 3.x. Thus having said that, Spring Shell 2.1.x is going to be for Spring Boot 2.6.x and future Spring Shell 3.x for Spring Boot 3.x.

Notable changes include:


  
New build-in version command

  
Starter for jna integration

  
Customizer for non-interactive runner

  
New styling and theming subsystem


Please see the release notes for more details.

Thanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests.
How can you help?

People can flexibly maneuver objects in their physical surroundings to accomplish various goals.

Robots that are faced with the real world will also inevitably encounter new user instructions and situations that were not seen during training.

Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly valuable for improved performance across a variety of consumer products, from recommendations to automatic image classification.  However, despite aggregating large amounts of data, in theory it is possible for models to encode characteristics of individual entries from the training set.  For example, experiments in controlled settings have shown that language models trained using email datasets may sometimes encode sensitive information included in the training data and may have the potential to reveal the presence of a particular user’s data in the training set. As such, it is important to prevent the encoding of such charac…]]></summary>

My friend, my hero, Stéphane Maldini, former project lead of Project Reactor and cofounder of the Reactive Streams initiative, passed away two months ago. We in the Java community made him a Java Champion posthumously. We miss him dearly. I think of him when I write reactive code.

Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide more accurate results as the size and coverage of their training data increases. While investing in high-quality and large-scale labeled datasets is one path to model improvement, another is leveraging prior knowledge, concisely referred to as “rules” — reasoning heuristics, equations, associative logic, or constraints. Consider a common example from physics where a model is given the task of predicting the next state in a double pendulum system. While the model may learn to estimate the total energy of the system at a given point in time only from empirical data, it will frequently overestimate the energy unless also provided an equation th…]]></summary>

Deep machine learning (ML) systems have achieved considerable success in medical image analysis in recent years. One major contributing factor is access to abundant labeled datasets, which are used to train highly effective supervised deep learning models. However, in the real-world, these models may encounter samples exhibiting rare conditions that are individually too infrequent for per-condition classification. Nevertheless, such conditions can be collectively common because they follow a long-tail distribution and when taken together can represent a significant portion of cases — e.g., in a recent deep learning dermatological study, hundreds of rare conditions composed around 20%…]]></summary>

Quantum processors are made of superconducting quantum bits (qubits) that — being quantum objects — are highly susceptible to even tiny amounts of environmental noise. This noise can cause errors in quantum computation that need to be addressed to continue advancing quantum computers. Our Sycamore processors are installed in specially designed cryostats, where they are sealed away from stray light and electromagnetic fields and are cooled down to very low temperatures to reduce thermal noise.

Image matting is the process of extracting a precise alpha matte that separates foreground and background objects in an image. This technique has been traditionally used in the filmmaking and photography industry for image and video editing purposes, e.g., background replacement, synthetic bokeh and other visual effects. Image matting assumes that an image is a composite of foreground and background images, and hence, the intensity of each pixel is a linear combination of the foreground and the background.  
   
In the case of traditional image segmentation, the image is segmented in a binary manner, in which a pixel either belongs to the foreground or background. This type of segmentation, however, is unab…]]></summary>

In ansible.utils, there are a variety of plugins which we can use for operational state assessment of network devices. I overviewed the ansible.utils collection in part one of this two part blog series. If you have not reviewed part one, I recommend you do so, since I will build on this information in this part two blog.

Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear. In fact, experts may identify up to 10x as many birds by ear as by sight. 
In recent years, autonomous recording units (ARUs) have made it easy to capture thousands of hours of audio in forests that could be used to better understand ecosystems and identify critical habitat. However, manually reviewing the audio data is very time co…]]></summary>
