So far the twenty-first century has unleashed a torrent of technological innovations, becoming a double-edged sword for governments worldwide. The growing burden of legacy IT systems, cybersecurity threats, AI incorporation, data privacy concerns, budgetary constraints, and shifting geopolitical landscapes puts governments at the forefront of a rapidly evolving environment. 

Governments around the world face similar challenges, and — rather than addressing each issue on their own — they can learn from each other's experiences. These seven technology obstacles are similar across regions and have the potential to spark larger conversations and collaboration, where appropriate.

DevOps and SRE teams are transforming the process of software development. While DevOps engineers focus on efficient software applications and service delivery, SRE teams are key to ensuring reliability, scalability, and performance.

In 1950, weather forecasting started its digital revolution when researchers used the first programmable, general-purpose computer ENIAC to solve mathematical equations describing how weather evolves. In the more than 70 years since, continuous advancements in computing power and improvements to the model formulations have led to steady gains in weather forecast skill: a 7-day forecast today is about as accurate as a 5-day forecast in 2000 and a 3-day forecast in 1980.

This can cause text instability (a “flicker” where previously displayed text is updated, shown in the captions on the left in the video below), which can impair users' reading experience due to distraction, fatigue, and difficulty following the conversation.






In “Modeling and Improving Text Stability in Live Captions”, presented at ACM CHI 2023, we f…]]></summary>

Simple and effective interaction between human and quadrupedal robots paves the way towards creating intelligent and capable helper robots, forging a future where technology enhances our lives in ways beyond our imagination. Key to such human-robot interaction systems is enabling quadrupedal robots to respond to natural language instructions. Recent developments in large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated the potential to perform high-level planning. Yet, it remains a challenge for LLMs to comprehend low-level commands, such as joint angle targets or motor torques, especially for inherently unstable legged robots, necessitating high-frequency control signals.

The ability to detect objects in the visual world is crucial for computer vision and machine intelligence, enabling applications like adaptive autonomous agents and versatile shopping systems. However, modern object detectors are limited by the manual annotations of their training data, resulting in a vocabulary size significantly smaller than the vast array of objects encountered in reality. To overcome this, the open-vocabulary detection task (OVD) has emerged, utilizing image-text pairs for training and incorporating new category names at test time by associating them with the image content. By treating categories as text embeddings, open-vocabulary detectors can predict a wide range of unseen objects. Various techniqu…]]></summary>

This blog describes the mixed version proxy, a new alpha feature in Kubernetes 1.28. The
mixed version proxy enables an HTTP request for a resource to be served by the correct API server
in cases where there are multiple API servers at varied versions in a cluster. For example,
this is useful during a cluster upgrade, or when you're rolling out the runtime configuration of
the cluster's control plane.
What problem does this solve?
When a cluster undergoes an upgrade, the kube-apiservers existing at different versions in that scenario can serve different sets (groups, versions, resources) of built-in resources. A resource request made in this scenario may be served by any of the available apiservers, potentially resulting in the request ending up at an apiserve…]]></summary>

This post explains how to use the new sidecar feature, which enables restartable init containers and is available in alpha in Kubernetes 1.28. We want your feedback so that we can graduate this feature as soon as possible.
The concept of a “sidecar” has been part of Kubernetes since nearly the very beginning. In 2015, sidecars were described in a blog post about composite containers as additional containers that “extend and enhance the ‘main’ container”. Sidecar containers have become a common Kubernetes deployment pattern and are often used for network proxies or as part of a logging system. Until now, sidecars were a concept that Kubernetes users applied without n…]]></summary>

A full-scale error-corrected quantum computer will be able to solve some problems that are impossible for classical computers, but building such a device is a huge endeavor. We are proud of the milestones that we have achieved toward a fully error-corrected quantum computer, but that large-scale computer is still some number of years away. Meanwhile, we are using our current noisy quantum processors as flexible platforms for quantum experiments. 



In contrast to an error-corrected quantum computer, experiments in noisy quantum processors are currently limited to a few thousand quantum operations or gates, before noise degrades the quantum state. In 2019 we implemented a specific computational t…]]></summary>

Large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-3 and PaLM, have shown impressive progress in recent years, which have been driven by scaling up models and training data sizes. Nonetheless, a long standing debate has been whether LLMs can reason symbolically (i.e., manipulating symbols based on logical rules). For example, LLMs are able to perform simple arithmetic operations when numbers are small, but struggle to perform with large numbers. This suggests that LLMs have not learned the underlying rules needed to perform these arithmetic operations. 



While neural networks have powerful pattern matching capabilities, they are prone to overfitting to spurious statistical patterns in the data. This does…]]></summary>

The 1.22 release introduced Alpha support
for configuring swap memory usage for Kubernetes workloads running on Linux on a per-node basis.
Now, in release 1.28, support for swap on Linux nodes has graduated to Beta, along with many
new improvements.
Prior to version 1.22, Kubernetes did not provide support for swap memory on Linux systems.
This was due to the inherent difficulty in guaranteeing and accounting for pod memory utilization
when swap memory was involved. As a result, swap support was deemed out of scope in the initial
design of Kubernetes, and the default behavior of a kubelet was to fail to start if swap memory
was detected on a node.
In version 1.22, the swap feature for Linux was initially introduced in its Alpha stage. This represented

The podresources API is an API served by the kubelet locally on the node, which exposes the compute resources exclusively
allocated to containers. With the release of Kubernetes 1.28, that API is now Generally Available.
What problem does it solve?
The kubelet can allocate exclusive resources to containers, like
CPUs, granting exclusive access to full cores
or memory, either regions or hugepages.
Workloads which require high performance, or low latency (or both) leverage these features.
The kubelet also can assign devices to containers.
Collectively, these features which enable exclusive assignments are known as "resource managers".
Without an API like podresources, the only possible option to learn about resource assignment was to read the state files th…]]></summary>

Empowering end-users to interactively teach robots to perform novel tasks is a crucial capability for their successful integration into real-world applications. For example, a user may want to teach a robot dog to perform a new trick, or teach a manipulator robot how to organize a lunch box based on user preferences. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive internet data have shown a promising path towards achieving this goal. Indeed, researchers have explored diverse ways of leveraging LLMs for robotics, from step-by-step planning and goal-oriented dialogue to robot-code-writing agents.

This blog discusses two new features in Kubernetes 1.28 to improve Jobs for batch
users: Pod replacement policy
and Backoff limit per index.
These features continue the effort started by the
Pod failure policy
to improve the handling of Pod failures in a Job.
Pod replacement policy
By default, when a pod enters a terminating state (e.g. due to preemption or
eviction), Kubernetes immediately creates a replacement Pod. Therefore, both Pods are running
at the same time. In API terms, a pod is considered terminating when it has a
deletionTimestamp and it has a phase Pending or Running.
The scenario when two Pods are running at a given time is problematic for
some popular machine learning frameworks, such as
TensorFlow and JAX, which r…]]></summary>

There has been great progress towards adapting large language models (LLMs) to accommodate multimodal inputs for tasks including image captioning, visual question answering (VQA), and open vocabulary recognition. Despite such achievements, current state-of-the-art visual language models (VLMs) perform inadequately on visual information seeking datasets, such as Infoseek and OK-VQA, where external knowledge is required to answer the questions.

Announcing graduation to General Availability (GA) - Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment in Kubernetes v1.28!
Kubernetes SIG Storage team is thrilled to announce that the "Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment" feature,
introduced as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.25, has now graduated to GA and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.28 release.
This enhancement brings a significant improvement to how default
StorageClasses are assigned to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
With this feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and then a PVC to assign the class.
Instead, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned will now be retroactively updated to include the default StorageClass.
This enhancement ensures that PVCs no longer get stuck in an unbound state, and storage provisioning works seamlessly,
even when a default StorageClass is not defined at the time of PVC creation.
What changed?
The PersistentVolume (PV) controller has been modified to automatically assign a default StorageClass to any unbound
PersistentVolumeClaim with the storageClassName not set. Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim
admission validation mechanism within
the API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.
How to use it?
As this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.
Simply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.
For more details, read about
default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.
To provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)
or participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.]]></summary>

Modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance across a variety of applications, such as language, mathematical reasoning, and vision. However, these networks often use large architectures that require lots of computational resources. This can make it impractical to serve such models to users, especially in resource-constrained environments like wearables and smartphones. A widely used approach to mitigate the inference costs of pre-trained networks is to prune them by removing some of their weights, in a way that doesn’t significantly affect utility. In standard neural networks, each weight defines a connection between two neurons. So after weights are pruned, the input…]]></summary>

The Kubernetes Non-Graceful Node Shutdown feature is now GA in Kubernetes v1.28.
It was introduced as
alpha
in Kubernetes v1.24, and promoted to
beta
in Kubernetes v1.26.
This feature allows stateful workloads to restart on a different node if the
original node is shutdown unexpectedly or ends up in a non-recoverable state
such as the hardware failure or unresponsive OS.
What is a Non-Graceful Node Shutdown
In a Kubernetes cluster, a node can be shutdown in a planned graceful way or
unexpectedly because of reasons such as power outage or something else external.
A node shutdown could lead to workload failure if the node is not drained
before the shutdown. A node shutdown can be either graceful or non-graceful.

Welcome to the world of Kubernetes and its vibrant contributor
community! In this blog post, we'll be shining a spotlight on the
Special Interest Group for Contributor
Experience
(SIG ContribEx), an essential component of the Kubernetes project.
SIG ContribEx in Kubernetes is responsible for developing and
maintaining a healthy and productive community of contributors to the
project. This involves identifying and addressing bottlenecks that may
hinder the project's growth and feature velocity, such as pull request
latency and the number of open pull requests and issues.
SIG ContribEx works to improve the overall contributor experience by
creating and maintaining guidelines, tools, and processes that
facilitate collaboration and communication among contributors. They

The last few years have seen rapid progress in systems that can automatically process complex business documents and turn them into structured objects. A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows. However, the datasets used in academic literature fail to capture the challenges seen in real-world use cases. Consequently, academic b…]]></summary>

Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…]]></summary>
