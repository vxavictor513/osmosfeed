        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Today, connected vehicles are proliferating, smart cities are translating from vision to reality, and cloud-based connectivity services are increasing. Advanced connectivity solutions like 5G, cloud-based services and automations, and personalized experiences are redefining in-vehicle experiences. In addition, the growth of an intelligent Edge, smart infrastructure, and the Internet of Things are pushing the boundaries of the connected car.

Supervised learning is a common approach to machine learning (ML) in which the model is trained using data that is labeled appropriately for the task at hand. Ordinary supervised learning trains on independent and identically distributed (IID) data, where all training examples are sampled from a fixed set of classes, and the model has access to these examples throughout the entire training phase. In contrast, continual learning tackles the problem of training a single model on changing data distributions where different classification tasks are presented sequentially. This is particularly important, for example, to enable autonomous agents to process and interpret continuous streams of informati…]]></summary>

As we enter the third year of the pandemic we continue to hear how Elasticians are juggling work, home, families, friends, and not to mention the other stressors that occur in everyday life. It is our goal to always support our employees where we can. That’s why Shut It Down days mean so much to Elasticians. 

The purpose of our Shut It Down days is to create extra space for our employees—it’s an evolution of our culture. Space, Time is a tenet of our Source Code. Instead of getting stuck in the day-to-day work pattern, we prioritize allowing for the space and time to breathe, recalibrate, and come back recharged.

The Linux process model, available within Elastic, allows users to write very targeted alerting rules and gain deeper insight into exactly what is happening on their Linux servers and desktops.
In this blog, we will provide background on the Linux process model, a key aspect of how Linux workloads are represented.
Linux follows the Unix process model from the 1970's that was augmented with the concept sessions in the 1980's judging from when the setsid() system call was introduced by early POSIX documents.
The Linux process model is a good abstraction for recording computer workloads (which programs are run) and for writing rules to react to these events. It offers a clear representation of who did what when on which server for alerting, compliance and threat hunting.

The ability to classify images into categories has been transformed by deep learning. It has also been significantly accelerated by transfer learning, whereby models are first pre-trained on large datasets, like ImageNet, to learn visual representations that are then transferred via fine-tuning to a new task with less data (e.g., classifying animals). Previous works such as BiT and ViT employed these methods to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a wide range of classification tasks, such as the VTAB benchmark. 
However, fine-tuning has some downsides: though pre-training is done only once, fine-tuning is necessary on every new dataset for which task-specific data is needed. Multimo…]]></summary>

Modern conversational agents need to integrate with an ever-increasing number of services to perform a wide variety of tasks, from booking flights and finding restaurants, to playing music and telling jokes. Adding this functionality can be difficult — for each new task, one needs to collect new data and retrain the models that power the conversational agent. This is because most task-oriented dialogue (TOD) models are trained on a single task-specific ontology. An ontology is generally represented as a list of possible user intents (e.g., if the user wants to book a flight, if the user wants to play some music, etc.) and possible parameter slots to extract from the conversation (e.g., the date of the flight, the…]]></summary>

Overview

While investigating the Spring Framework RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965 and the suggested workaround, we realized that the disallowedFields configuration setting on WebDataBinder is not intuitive and is not clearly documented. We have fixed that but also decided to be on the safe side and announce a follow-up CVE, in order to ensure application developers are alerted and have a chance to review their configuration.


  
CVE-2022-22968: Spring Framework Data Binding Rules Vulnerability


We have released Spring Framework 5.3.19 and 5.2.21 which contain the fix. Spring Boot 2.6.7 and 2.5.13 are scheduled to be released on April 21, 2022.

LiDAR and visual cameras are two types of complementary sensors used for 3D object detection in autonomous vehicles and robots. LiDAR, which is a remote sensing technique that uses light in the form of a pulsed laser to measure ranges, provides low-resolution shape and depth information, while cameras provide high-resolution shape and texture information. While the features captured by LiDAR and cameras should be merged together to provide optimal 3D object detection, it turns out that most state-of-the-art 3D object detectors use LiDAR as the only input. The main reason is that to develop robust 3D object detection models, most methods need to augment and transform th…]]></summary>

In a world of more sophisticated threats, a dispersed workforce, and greater demands on their time, cybersecurity leaders must identify what comes after zero trust, security orchestration, and other practices that help organizations remain resilient in the face of rising attacks.
While there are no panaceas, experts say emerging technologies and operational practices can tilt the playing field in their direction. We asked several security experts to weigh in on the cybersecurity technologies they believe will matter most in the coming years, and the critical challenges they’re expected to solve.

The common theme across these conversations is a set of tools and strategies that addresses cybersecurity as a data challenge.

It’s no secret that cloud service providers like AWS, Google Cloud, and Azure give teams incredible power and flexibility when it comes to delivering great solutions and user experiences to a global customer base. Leveraging the power of one or more clouds is often seen as a critical competency for an organization to succeed. This power of course comes with the added complexity of monitoring and securing cloud workloads — often running on multiple underlying technologies with varying levels of control, access, and exposure.
In this blog post, we focus on the approach that should be considered for securing AWS-based workloads and how Elastic Security can help security teams prevent, detect, and respond to threats in their AWS environment. Follow-up blogs will address other cloud providers…]]></summary>

Lauderdale, Florida to discuss the evolving threats to ports – a key sector within the nation’s critical infrastructure – and how to better protect them. The event comes at a time when the world watches conflict unfold between Russia and Ukraine, prompting new warnings from the administration that cyber attacks may occur outside of this warzone, so critical infrastructure owners and operators need to accelerate efforts to lock their digital doors.
Hack the Port made clear that there are key themes that any critical infrastructure owner and operator – whether public or private sector – needs to keep in mind in order to lock their digital doors. Those themes are outlined here.

Matrix factorization is one of the oldest, yet still widely used, techniques for learning how to recommend items such as songs or movies from user ratings. In its basic form, it approximates a large, sparse (i.e., mostly empty) matrix of user-item interactions with a product of two smaller, denser matrices representing learned item and user features. These dense matrices, in turn, can be used to recommend items to a user with which they haven't interacted before. 
Despite its algorithmic simplicity, matrix factorization can still achieve competitive performance in recommender benchmarks. Alternating least squares (ALS), and especially its implicit variation, is a fundamental algorithm to learn the parameters of matrix factorization…]]></summary>

Recent years have seen a tremendous increase in the creation and serving of video content to users across the world in a variety of languages and over numerous platforms. The process of creating high quality content can include several stages from video capturing and captioning to  video and audio editing. In some cases dialogue is re-recorded (referred to as dialog replacement, post-sync or dubbing) in a studio in order to achieve high quality and replace original audio that might have been recorded in noisy conditions. However, the dialog replacement process can be difficult and tedious because the newly recorded audio needs to be well synced with the video, requiring …]]></summary>

Reinforcement learning (RL) can be used to train a policy to perform a task via trial and error, but a major challenge in RL is learning policies from scratch in environments with hard exploration challenges. For example, consider the setting depicted in the door-binary-v0 environment from the adroit manipulation suite, where an RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. 
   


An RL agent must control a hand in 3D space to open a door placed in front of it. The agent receives a reward signal only when the door is completely open.

   
Since the agent receives no intermediary rewards, it cannot measure how close it is to completing the task, and so must explore …]]></summary>

Ever queried a recommender system and found that the same search only a few moments later or on a different device yields very different results? This is not uncommon and can be frustrating if a person is looking for something specific. As a designer of such a system, it is also not uncommon for the metrics measured to change from design and testing to deployment, bringing into question the utility of the experimental testing phase. Some level of such irreproducibility can be expected as the world changes and new models are deployed. However, this also happens regularly as requests hit duplicates of the same model or models are being refreshed.

In recent years, large neural networks trained for language understanding and generation have achieved impressive results across a wide range of tasks. GPT-3 first showed that large language models (LLMs) can be used for few-shot learning and can achieve impressive results without large-scale task-specific data collection or model parameter updating. More recent LLMs, such as GLaM, LaMDA, Gopher, and Megatron-Turing NLG, achieved state-of-the-art few-shot results on many tasks by scaling model size, using sparsely activated modules, and training on larger datasets from more diverse sources.

Automatic translation of speech from one language to speech in another language, called speech-to-speech translation (S2ST), is important for breaking down the communication barriers between people speaking different languages. Conventionally, automatic S2ST systems are built with a cascade of automatic speech recognition (ASR), text-to-text machine translation (MT), and text-to-speech (TTS) synthesis sub-systems, so that the system overall is text-centric. Recently, work on S2ST that doesn’t rely on intermediate text representation is emerging, such as end-to-end direct S2ST (e.g., Translatotron) and cascade S2ST based on learned discrete representations of speech (e.g., Tjandra et al.).

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Yesterday we announced a Spring Framework RCE vulnerability CVE-2022-22965, listing Apache Tomcat as one of several preconditions. The Apache Tomcat team has since released versions 10.0.20, 9.0.62, and 8.5.78 all of which close the attack vector on Tomcat’s side. While the vulnerability is not in Tomcat itself, in real world situations, it is important to be able to choose among multiple upgrade paths that in turn provides flexibility and layered protection. 

Upgrading to Spring Framework 5.3.18+ or 5.2.20+ continues to be our main recommendation not only because it addresses the root cause and prevents other possible attack vectors, but also because it adds protection for other CVEs addressed since the current version in use. 

For older, unsupported versions of the Spring Framework, the Tomcat releases provide an adequate solution for the reported attack vector. Nevertheless, we must stress that this should only be seen as a tactical solution, while the main goal should still be to upgrade to a currently supported Spring Framework version as soon as possible.

Last but not least, it’s worth mentioning that downgrading to Java 8 provides another viable workaround, which may be another tactical solution option.]]></summary>

Three years ago we wrote about our work on predicting a number of cardiovascular risk factors from fundus photos (i.e., photos of the back of the eye)1 using deep learning. That such risk factors could be extracted from fundus photos was a novel discovery and thus a surprising outcome to clinicians and laypersons alike. Since then, we and other researchers have discovered additional novel biomarkers from fundus photos, such as markers for chronic kidney disease and diabetes, and hemoglobin levels to detect anemia.  
A unifying goal of work like this is to develop new disease detection or monitoring approaches that are less invasive, more accurate, cheaper and more readily available. How…]]></summary>

For many of us, it can be challenging to keep up with the volume of documents that arrive in our inboxes every day: reports, reviews, briefs, policies and the list goes on. When a new document is received, readers often wish it included a brief summary of the main points in order to effectively prioritize it. However, composing a document summary can be cognitively challenging and time-consuming, especially when a document writer is starting from scratch. 
 To help with this, we recently announced that Google Docs now automatically generates suggestions to aid document writers in creating content summaries, when they are available. Today we describe how this was enab…]]></summary>
