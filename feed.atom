Whether referred to as “customer experience” or “citizen experience,” making sure people are satisfied with their digital interactions is a clear priority for the U.S. federal government. In September 2023, the U.S. Office of Management and Budget (OMB), released the “Delivering a Digital First Public Experience” memorandum (OMB M-23-22). This document offers a policy framework for federal agencies as they continue to optimize online services and experiences. It also reflects growing citizen expectations for their digital interactions with the government.
From a citizen’s perspective, digital experience is an area where the government has significant room for improvement. Only 8% of Americans say the U.S. government is responsive to the needs of ordinary Americans, according to Pew Research. And a McKinsey study found that the public sector is ranked lowest of 10 industries for customer satisfaction. Undoubtedly contributing to this dissatisfaction is the fact that private sector companies have set the digital bar so high. From online banking to one-click purchasing, frictionless digital interactions have become the norm for many citizens — and in many cases an expectation versus a “nice-to-have.”
Unlike in many sectors, however, the consequences of a poor customer experience in the public sector can have ramifications beyond lost sales and revenue. The breadth of impact is significant: U.S. federal websites receive about 2 billion visits per month or almost 80 million hours of digital interactions with citizens. A suboptimal digital experience can mean that constituents don’t get access to critical support and services that affect their health and well-being. The U.S. government estimates that $140 billion in potential benefits go unused each year because of “outdated or complicated processes.”

As the second largest and active Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) project, OpenTelemetry is well on its way to becoming the ubiquitous, unified standard and framework for observability. OpenTelemetry owes this success to its comprehensive and feature-rich toolset that allows users to retrieve valuable observability data from their applications with low effort. The OpenTelemetry Java agent is one of the most mature and feature-rich components in OpenTelemetry’s ecosystem. It provides automatic instrumentation for JVM-based applications and comes with a broad coverage of auto-instrumentation modules for popular Java-frameworks and libraries.

The original instrumentation approach used in the OpenTelemetry Java agent left the maintenance and development of auto-instrumentation modules subject to some restrictions. As part of our reinforced commitment to OpenTelemetry, Elastic® helps evolve and improve OpenTelemetry projects and components. Elastic’s contribution of the Elastic Common Schema to OpenTelemetry was an important step for the open-source community. As another step in our commitment to OpenTelemetry, Elastic started contributing to the OpenTelemetry Java agent.

Today we are releasing ingress2gateway, a tool
that can help you migrate from Ingress to Gateway
API. Gateway API is just weeks away from graduating to GA, if you
haven't upgraded yet, now's the time to think about it!
Background
In the ever-evolving world of Kubernetes, networking plays a pivotal role. As more applications are
deployed in Kubernetes clusters, effective exposure of these services to clients becomes a critical
concern. If you've been working with Kubernetes, you're likely familiar with the Ingress API,
which has been the go-to solution for managing external access to services.
The Ingress API provides a way to route external traffic to your applications within the cluster,
making it an indispensable tool for many Kub…]]></summary>

It’s that time of year again. Fall leaves are turning colors, families are gearing up for the holidays, and many vendors are releasing different reports during cybersecurity month. Our researchers at Elastic Security Labs released the 2023 Global Threat Report last week after months of analysis on more than 1 billion data points. As the CISO of Elastic®, my team and I leveraged last year’s report findings and predictions to strategize for the changing threat landscape. This year, I expect our team will dig further on the new threat research discoveries and predictions. In particular, my team and I are taking note of the following insights while preparing for the next year.

Since 2018, one of my favourite contributions to the Kubernetes community has been to share the story of each release. Many of these stories were told on behalf of a past employer; by popular demand, I've brought them back, now under my own name. If you were a fan of the old show, I would be delighted if you would subscribe.
Back in August, we welcomed the release of Kubernetes 1.28. That release was led by Grace Nguyen, a CS student at the University of Waterloo. Grace joined me for the traditional release interview, and while you can read her story below, I encourage you to listen to it if you can.
This transcript has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.

Elastic Observability is the optimal tool to provide visibility into your running web apps. Microsoft Azure Container Apps is a fully managed environment that enables you to run containerized applications on a serverless platform so that your applications scale up and down. This allows you to accomplish the dual objective of serving every customer’s need for availability while meeting your needs to do so as efficiently as possible.

Using Elastic Observability and Azure Container Apps is a perfect combination for developers to deploy  web apps that are auto-scaled with fully observable operations.

In the recent Kubernetes v1.28 release, we (SIG Storage) introduced a new alpha feature that aims to improve PersistentVolume (PV)
storage management and help cluster administrators gain better insights into the lifecycle of PVs.
With the addition of the lastPhaseTransitionTime field into the status of a PV,
cluster administrators are now able to track the last time a PV transitioned to a different
phase, allowing for more efficient
and informed resource management.
Why do we need new PV field?
PersistentVolumes in Kubernetes play a crucial role in providing storage resources to workloads running in the cluster.
However, managing these PVs effectively can be challenging, especially when it comes

Asset tracking and management in the military is like playing a game of chess — you need to know where all your pieces are to make the right moves. Assets can be anything from troops, vehicles, IT equipment, or supplies, and having a way to visualize and track assets can improve the decisions made in tactical scenarios. 
Real-time situational awareness (RTSA) and asset tracking go hand in hand. Fast, accurate asset tracking can be enabled by RTSA capabilities such as monitoring, managing, and responding to dynamic situations (including real-time monitoring of data points), aggregating and analyzing large volumes of data, and integrating multiple streams into a common location for visualization and decision-making.

Prompting large language models (LLMs) has become an efficient learning paradigm for adapting LLMs to a new task by conditioning on human-designed instructions. The remarkable in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs also leads to efficient few-shot learners that can generalize from few-shot input-label pairs. However, the predictions of LLMs are highly sensitive and even biased to the choice of templates, label spaces (such as yes/no, true/false, correct/incorrect), and demonstration examples, resulting in unexpected performance degradation and barriers for pursuing robust LLM applications. To address this problem, calibration methods have been developed to mitigate the effects of t…]]></summary>

If you’ve paid attention to the quantum computing space, you’ve heard the claim that in the future, quantum computers will solve certain problems exponentially more efficiently than classical computers can. They have the potential to transform many industries, from pharmaceuticals to energy.



For the most part, these claims have rested on arguments about the asymptotic scaling of algorithms as the problem size approaches infinity, but this tells us very little about the practical performance of quantum computers for finite-sized problems. We want to be more concrete: Exactly which problems are quantum computers more suited to tackle than their classical counterparts, an…]]></summary>

Ever wonder how software gets deployed onto a system that is deliberately disconnected from the Internet and other networks? These systems are typically disconnected due to their sensitive nature. Sensitive as in utilities (power/water), banking, healthcare, weapons systems, other government use cases, etc. Sometimes it's technically a water gap, if you're running Kubernetes on an underwater vessel. Still, these environments need software to operate. This concept of deployment in a disconnected state is what it means to deploy to the other side of an air gap.
Again, despite this posture, software still needs to run in these environments. Traditionally, software artifacts are physically carried across the air gap on hard drives, USB sticks, CDs, or flo…]]></summary>

As most people navigate their everyday world, they process visual input from the environment using an eye-level perspective. Unlike robots and self-driving cars, people don't have any "out-of-body" sensors to help guide them. Instead, a person’s sensory input is completely "egocentric", or "from the self." This also applies to new technologies that understand the world around us from a human-like perspective, e.g., robots navigating through unknown buildings, AR glasses that highlight objects, or assistive technology to help people run independently.

Typical deep learning models for computer vision, like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and vision transformers (ViT), process signals assuming planar (flat) spaces. For example, digital images are represented as a grid of pixels on a plane. However, this type of data makes up only a fraction of the data we encounter in scientific applications. Variables sampled from the Earth's atmosphere, like temperature and humidity, are naturally represented on the sphere. Some kinds of cosmological data and panoramic photos are also spherical signals, and are better treated as such. 



Using methods designed for planar images to process spherical signals is problematic for a couple of reasons. Firs…]]></summary>

A mobile phone’s camera is a powerful tool for capturing everyday moments. However, capturing a dynamic scene using a single camera is fundamentally limited. For instance, if we wanted to adjust the camera motion or timing of a recorded video (e.g., to freeze time while sweeping the camera around to highlight a dramatic moment), we would typically need an expensive Hollywood setup with a synchronized camera rig. Would it be possible to achieve similar effects solely from a video captured using a mobile phone’s camera, without a Hollywood budget?

Deep neural networks (DNNs) have become essential for solving a wide range of tasks, from standard supervised learning (image classification using ViT) to meta-learning. The most commonly-used paradigm for learning DNNs is empirical risk minimization (ERM), which aims to identify a network that minimizes the average loss on training data points. Several algorithms, including stochastic gradient descent (SGD), Adam, and Adagrad, have been proposed for solving ERM. However, a drawback of ERM is that it weights all the samples equally, often ignoring the rare and more difficult samples, and focusing on the easier and abundant samples. This leads to suboptimal performance on unseen data, espe…]]></summary>
