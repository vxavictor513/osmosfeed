Francesco Romani (Red Hat)
The podresources API is an API served by the kubelet locally on the node, which exposes the compute resources exclusively
allocated to containers. With the release of Kubernetes 1.28, that API is now Generally Available.
What problem does it solve?
The kubelet can allocate exclusive resources to containers, like
CPUs, granting exclusive access to full cores
or memory, either regions or hugepages.
Workloads which require high performance, or low latency (or both) leverage these features.
The kubelet also can assign devices to containers.
Collectively, these features which enable exclusive assignments are known as "resource managers".
Without an API like podresources, the only possible option to learn about resource assignment was to read the state files th…]]></summary>

Empowering end-users to interactively teach robots to perform novel tasks is a crucial capability for their successful integration into real-world applications. For example, a user may want to teach a robot dog to perform a new trick, or teach a manipulator robot how to organize a lunch box based on user preferences. The recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) pre-trained on extensive internet data have shown a promising path towards achieving this goal. Indeed, researchers have explored diverse ways of leveraging LLMs for robotics, from step-by-step planning and goal-oriented dialogue to robot-code-writing agents. 



While these methods impart new modes of compositional generalization, they focus on using lang…]]></summary>

This blog discusses two new features in Kubernetes 1.28 to improve Jobs for batch
users: Pod replacement policy
and Backoff limit per index.
These features continue the effort started by the
Pod failure policy
to improve the handling of Pod failures in a Job.
Pod replacement policy
By default, when a pod enters a terminating state (e.g. due to preemption or
eviction), Kubernetes immediately creates a replacement Pod. Therefore, both Pods are running
at the same time. In API terms, a pod is considered terminating when it has a
deletionTimestamp and it has a phase Pending or Running.
The scenario when two Pods are running at a given time is problematic for
some popular machine learning frameworks, such as
TensorFlow and JAX, which r…]]></summary>

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Author: Roman Bednář (Red Hat)
Announcing graduation to General Availability (GA) - Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment in Kubernetes v1.28!
Kubernetes SIG Storage team is thrilled to announce that the "Retroactive Default StorageClass Assignment" feature,
introduced as an alpha in Kubernetes v1.25, has now graduated to GA and is officially part of the Kubernetes v1.28 release.
This enhancement brings a significant improvement to how default
StorageClasses are assigned to PersistentVolumeClaims (PVCs).
With this feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and then a PVC to assign the class.
Instead, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned will now be retroactively updated to include the default StorageClass.
This enhancement ensures that PVCs no longer get stuck in an unbound state, and storage provisioning works seamlessly,
even when a default StorageClass is not defined at the time of PVC creation.
What changed?
The PersistentVolume (PV) controller has been modified to automatically assign a default StorageClass to any unbound
PersistentVolumeClaim with the storageClassName not set. Additionally, the PersistentVolumeClaim
admission validation mechanism within
the API server has been adjusted to allow changing values from an unset state to an actual StorageClass name.
How to use it?
As this feature has graduated to GA, there's no need to enable a feature gate anymore.
Simply make sure you are running Kubernetes v1.28 or later, and the feature will be available for use.
For more details, read about
default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation.
You can also read the previous blog post announcing beta graduation in v1.26.
To provide feedback, join our Kubernetes Storage Special-Interest-Group (SIG)
or participate in discussions on our public Slack channel.]]></summary>

Modern neural networks have achieved impressive performance across a variety of applications, such as language, mathematical reasoning, and vision. However, these networks often use large architectures that require lots of computational resources. This can make it impractical to serve such models to users, especially in resource-constrained environments like wearables and smartphones. A widely used approach to mitigate the inference costs of pre-trained networks is to prune them by removing some of their weights, in a way that doesn’t significantly affect utility. In standard neural networks, each weight defines a connection between two neurons. So after weights are pruned, the input…]]></summary>

This feature allows stateful workloads to restart on a different node if the

What is a Non-Graceful Node Shutdown
In a Kubernetes cluster, a node can be shutdown in a planned graceful way or

A node shutdown could lead to workload failure if the node is not drained
before the shutdown. A node shutdown can be either graceful or non-graceful.

Application performance monitoring (APM) is much more than capturing and tracking errors and stack traces. Today’s cloud-based businesses deploy applications across various regions and even cloud providers. So, harnessing the power of metadata provided by the Elastic APM agents becomes more critical. Leveraging the metadata, including crucial information like cloud region, provider, and machine type, allows us to track costs across the application stack. In this blog post, we look at how we can use cloud metadata to empower businesses to make smarter and cost-effective decisions, all while improving resource utilization and the user experience.

In 1991, a weather system formed off the east coast of the United States with a cold front that created a low pressure ridge to the east of Nova Scotia. At the same time, a high-pressure system extending out from the Appalachian Mountains forced the ridge first southeast and then to the west, where it encountered the remnants of Hurricane Grace, which it promptly absorbed and swelled in size as it did so. The resulting storm caused over $200 million of damage to the United States and was known as “The Perfect Storm,” later to be immortalized in a book of the same name. 

For public sector organizations trying to deliver cybersecurity, a similar pattern is emerging — but perhaps with less visible effects. Disparate elements are combining with rapid intensity and have the potential to unleash a ferocious assault on the world’s cyber defenses.
Security threats and citizen data,
Thirdly, given this proliferation of security threats and the need to protect citizen data, governments are likely to increase regulation and compliance requirements. This puts additional pressure on public sector teams to learn and implement these new requirements — it may also have the adverse effect of plugging holes today without thinking about future needs.]]></summary>

After Wes Mason was promoted to Site Reliability Engineer (SRE) Lead during the pandemic, he noticed that many of his typical coping mechanisms started to crumble.
While he suspected he had some form of neurodivergence, he didn’t have a diagnosis. Now he has a confirmed ADHD diagnosis after ticking nine of the 10 boxes on the evaluation. 
Being an SRE lead doesn’t involve managerial tasks, Wes says. But, it does involve meetings and being available to people to give feedback and technical guidance.
“I struggled with the role because people were waiting on me and I was losing focus,” he says.
“My ADHD means I can hyper focus, which can be an engineering superpower, but it also means that my brain struggles to focus when it’s not engaged. It becomes very hard to concentrate and work throug…]]></summary>

In previous blogs, we explored how Elastic Observability can help you monitor various AWS services and analyze them effectively:


Managing fundamental AWS services such as Amazon EC2, Amazon RDS, Amazon VPC, and NAT gateway
Data can be ingested into Elastic observability using a serverless forwarder or Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose
Ingesting and analyzing AWS VPC Flow logs


One of the more heavily used AWS container services is Amazon ECS (Elastic Container Service). While there is a trend toward using Fargate to simplify the setup and management of ECS clusters, many users still prefer using Amazon ECS with EC2 instances. It may not be as straightforward or efficient as AWS Fargate, but it offers more control over the underlying infrastructure.

Stephanie Harris has always had an interest in computers, but her initial career path started out in a different direction. 

Now, she’s a Senior Software Engineer at Elastic. 

Since she was young, Stephanie says she’s always had the ability to take confusing concepts and make them “make sense,” a skill that helped her on her winding path which eventually led her to Elastic. 

While Stephanie liked computers, she had also started teaching herself to play guitar at age thirteen. Never taking lessons, she learned through YouTube videos and a lot of practice. 

“I don’t mind struggling at something,” she says. “I was very, very bad at guitar at the beginning, and then one day I wasn’t bad anymore.”

The last few years have seen rapid progress in systems that can automatically process complex business documents and turn them into structured objects. A system that can automatically extract data from documents, e.g., receipts, insurance quotes, and financial statements, has the potential to dramatically improve the efficiency of business workflows by avoiding error-prone, manual work. Recent models, based on the Transformer architecture, have shown impressive gains in accuracy. Larger models, such as PaLM 2, are also being leveraged to further streamline these business workflows. However, the datasets used in academic literature fail to capture the challenges seen in real-world use cases. Consequently, academic b…]]></summary>

Adaptive computation refers to the ability of a machine learning system to adjust its behavior in response to changes in the environment. While conventional neural networks have a fixed function and computation capacity, i.e., they spend the same number of FLOPs for processing different inputs, a model with adaptive and dynamic computation modulates the computational budget it dedicates to processing each input, depending on the complexity of the input.


Adaptive computation in neural networks is appealing for two key reasons. First, the mechanism that introduces adaptivity provides an inductive bias that can play a key role in solving some challenging tasks. For instance, enabling different num…]]></summary>

Medicine is an inherently multimodal discipline.

Over the last decade or so, AI systems have achieved expert-level performance on specific tasks within specific modalities — some AI systems processing CT scans, while others analyzing high magnification pathology slides, and still others hunting for rare genetic variations.

Trying to make these programmatic changes using a mixture of YAML and Jinja inside of roles and playbooks is a headache of its own. While many of these options will work, they aren’t very efficient or easy to implement. Ansible Playbooks were never meant for programming.]]></summary>

Deep learning has recently made tremendous progress in a wide range of problems and applications, but models often fail unpredictably when deployed in unseen domains or distributions. Source-free domain adaptation (SFDA) is an area of research that aims to design methods for adapting a pre-trained model (trained on a “source domain”) to a new “target domain”, using only unlabeled data from the latter. 
 

Designing adaptation methods for deep models is an important area of research. While the increasing scale of models and training datasets has been a key ingredient to their success, a negative consequence of this trend is that training such models is increasingly computationally expe…]]></summary>
