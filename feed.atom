        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Posted by Ellery Wulczyn and Yun Liu, Google Research  
When a patient is diagnosed with cancer, one of the most important steps is examination of the tumor under a microscope by pathologists to determine the cancer stage and to characterize the tumor. This information is central to understanding clinical prognosis (i.e., likely patient outcomes) and for determining the most appropriate treatment, such as undergoing surgery alone versus surgery plus chemotherapy. Developing machine learning (ML) tools in pathology to assist with the microscopic review represents a compelling research area with many potential applications. 

Previous studies have shown that ML can accurately identify and classify tumors in pathology images and can even predict patient prognosis using known pathology feature…]]></summary>

Lichess is a platform that allows you to play chess; it publishes all rated games as archives, starting in 2013. There are a total of 4 billion games played. Yes, 4 billion matches.
Analyzing the data
We first want to look at a general overview and get an idea of the data we gathered.

We immediately noticed that Lichess had a slow start and picked up the page in early 2020. The top value of 4,095,987,675 represents all documents that fit the time picker range. This equals the game…]]></summary>

Recent years have seen tremendous advances across machine learning domains, from models that can explain jokes or answer visual questions in a variety of languages to those that can produce images based on text descriptions. Such innovations have been possible due to the increase in availability of large scale datasets along with novel advances that enable the training of models on these data. While scaling of robotics models has seen some success, it is outpaced by other domains due to a lack of datasets available on a scale comparable to large text corpora or image datasets.

Worldwide bird populations are declining at an alarming rate, with approximately 48% of existing bird species known or suspected to be experiencing population declines. For instance, the U.S. and Canada have reported 29% fewer birds since 1970. 

Effective monitoring of bird populations is essential for the development of solutions that promote conservation. Monitoring allows researchers to better understand the severity of the problem for specific bird populations and evaluate whether existing interventions are working. To scale monitoring, bird researchers have started analyzing ecosystems remotely using bird sound recordings instead of physically in-person via passive acoustic monitoring.

Last November, we announced the 1,000 Languages Initiative, an ambitious commitment to build a machine learning (ML) model that would support the world’s one thousand most-spoken languages, bringing greater inclusion to billions of people around the globe. However, some of these languages are spoken by fewer than twenty million people, so a core challenge is how to support languages for which there are relatively few speakers or limited available data. 

Today, we are excited to share more about the Universal Speech Model (USM), a critical first step towards supporting 1,000 languages. USM is a family of state-of-the-art speech models with 2B parameters trained on 12 million hours of speech and 28 b…]]></summary>

Lichess is a platform that allows you to play chess; luckily for us, it publishes all rated games as archives, starting in 2013. There are a total of over 4 billion games played. Yes, 4 billion matches.

Ingesting 4 billion documents is something that the Elastic Stack can handle easily. However, my custom Python implementation to extract and ship those documents out of Lichess faced severe performance problems.

Despite decades of research, we don’t see many mobile robots roaming our homes, offices, and streets. Real-world robot navigation in human-centric environments remains an unsolved problem. These challenging situations require safe and efficient navigation through tight spaces, such as squeezing between coffee tables and couches, maneuvering in tight corners, doorways, untidy rooms, and more. An equally critical requirement is to navigate in a manner that complies with unwritten social norms around people, for example, yielding at blind corners or staying at a comfortable distance.

Federated learning is a distributed way of training machine learning (ML) models where data is locally processed and only focused model updates and metrics that are intended for immediate aggregation are shared with a server that orchestrates training. This allows the training of models on locally available signals without exposing raw data to servers, increasing user privacy. In 2021, we announced that we are using federated learning to train Smart Text Selection models, an Android feature that helps users select and copy text easily by predicting what text they want to select and then automatically expanding the selection for them.

Industrial applications of machine learning are commonly composed of various items that have differing data modalities or feature distributions. Heterogeneous graphs (HGs) offer a unified view of these multimodal data systems by defining multiple types of nodes (for each data type) and edges (for the relation between data items). For instance, e-commerce networks might have [user, product, review] nodes or video platforms might have [channel, user, video, comment] nodes. Heterogeneous graph neural networks (HGNNs) learn node embeddings summarizing each node’s relationships into a vector. However, in real world HGs, there is often a label imbalance issue between different node …]]></summary>

Employee resource groups, or as we like to call them, Elastician resource groups, have been an informal part of Elastic’s culture since 2016. They started as Slack channels that any Elastician could join.

These ERGs were formalized in 2021 to ensure that the members would have structure, budget, and ultimately, a voice based on any dimension of diversity, allyship, and advocacy. This was an important step in our global diversity, equity, and inclusion journey.

Our ERGs are aligned to shared identities, interests, affinities, or allyships. The goal is to create a community of people with something in common and to encourage sharing, learning, and networking.

Unfortunately, the result is a large array of disparate data silos that were never designed to interact with each other.

Previously, we investigated various UI modeling tasks, including widget captioning, screen summarization, and command grounding, that address diverse interaction scenarios such as automation and accessibility. We also demonstrated how machine learning can help user experience practitioners improve UI quality by diagnosing tappability confusion and providing insights for improving UI design. These works along with those developed by others in the field have showcased how deep neural networks can potentially transform end user experiences and the interaction design practice.

Reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms can learn skills to solve decision-making tasks like playing games, enabling robots to pick up objects, or even optimizing microchip designs. However, running RL algorithms in the real world requires expensive active data collection. Pre-training on diverse datasets has proven to enable data-efficient fine-tuning for individual downstream tasks in natural language processing (NLP) and vision problems. In the same way that BERT or GPT-3 models provide general-purpose initialization for NLP, large RL–pre-trained models could provide general-purpose initialization for decision-making. So, we ask the question: Can we enable similar pre-training to accele…]]></summary>

Many years from today, scientists will be able to use fault-tolerant quantum computers for large-scale computations with applications across science and industry. These quantum computers will be much bigger than today, consisting of millions of coherent quantum bits, or qubits. But there’s a catch — these basic building blocks must be good enough or the systems will be overrun with errors. 

Currently, the error rates of the qubits on our 3rd generation Sycamore processor are typically between 1 in 10,000 to 1 in 100. Through our work and that of others, we understand that developing large-scale quantum computers will require far lower error rates. We will n…]]></summary>

Many languages spoken worldwide cover numerous regional varieties (sometimes called dialects), such as Brazilian and European Portuguese or Mainland and Taiwan Mandarin Chinese. Although such varieties are often mutually intelligible to their speakers, there are still important differences. For example, the Brazilian Portuguese word for “bus” is ônibus, while the European Portuguese word is autocarro. Yet, today’s machine translation (MT) systems typically do not allow users to specify which variety of a language to translate into. This may lead to confusion if the system outputs the “wrong” variety or mixes varieties in an unnatural way. Also, region-unaware MT systems tend to favor whichever v…]]></summary>

Differential privacy (DP) machine learning algorithms protect user data by limiting the effect of each data point on an aggregated output with a mathematical guarantee. Intuitively the guarantee implies that changing a single user’s contribution should not significantly change the output distribution of the DP algorithm. 

However, DP algorithms tend to be less accurate than their non-private counterparts because satisfying DP is a worst-case requirement: one has to add noise to “hide” changes in any potential input point, including "unlikely points’’ that have a significant impact on the aggregation. For example, suppose we want to privately estimate the average of a dataset, and we know that a sphere of dia…]]></summary>
