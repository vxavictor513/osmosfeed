I hope you are enjoying Spring One Essentials these days. The most exciting feature for me is an Observability which is spread throughout the Spring portfolio from now on.
Nevertheless, today I’d like to share with a project I’m working on since holidays, where the mentioned observability makes a perfect sense, too.



I’ll start from the far.
Let’s imagine we are learning a new programming language! I do learn Go to better understand Kubernetes, for example.
Of course, we deal with some primitives and basic structures, first of all.
Then we implement some well-known algorithms like bubble sort, Fibonacci number or sqrt function to get used to the language style and expectations.
And now what?
We have some real use-cases where this or that functionality…]]></summary>

In many computing applications the system needs to make decisions to serve requests that arrive in an online fashion. Consider, for instance, the example of a navigation app that responds to driver requests. In such settings there is inherent uncertainty about important aspects of the problem. For example, the preferences of the driver with respect to features of the route are often unknown and the delays of road segments can be uncertain. The field of online machine learning studies such settings and provides various techniques for decision-making problems under uncertainty.

Today many people have digital access to their medical records, including their doctor’s clinical notes. However, clinical notes are hard to understand because of the specialized language that clinicians use, which contains unfamiliar shorthand and abbreviations. In fact, there are thousands of such abbreviations, many of which are specific to certain medical specialities and locales or can mean multiple things in different contexts.

If the answer to these questions is yes, then Elastic’s Data Exfiltration Detection package can help you identify when critical enterprise data is being stolen and exfiltrated.
What is data exfiltration?
Data exfiltration is the unauthorized transfer of data from a device or network. In simple terms, it is a type of data loss — and to enterprises, it may also mean risk exposure. Data exfiltration can be conducted by outsiders of an organization who compromise the network to steal company secrets or credentials. Another way data exfiltration can occur i…]]></summary>

Elasticsearch is introducing a new type of vector in 8.6! This vector has 8-bit integer dimensions, where each dimension has a range of [-128, 127]. This is 4x smaller than the current vector with 32-bit float dimensions, which can result in substantial space savings.
You can start indexing these smaller, 8-bit vectors right now by adding the element_type parameter with the byte value to your vector mappings, similar to the example below.

        <summary type="html"><![CDATA[Hot on the heels of Spring Boot 3.0.2, I am excited to announce the 0.3 release of Spring Modulith.
The release is packed with improvements.
We have tweaked a couple of things that might require your attention and a couple of adapting changes to your code.
The most notable changes are:





GH-114 – We renamed the ….modulith.model package to ….modulith.core. This primarily affects ApplicationModules. Please adapt your imports accordingly.



GH-120 – The documentation support now generates diagram files using the *.puml file extension, as suggested by PlantUML. Please adapt your imports accordingly.



GH-103 – ApplicationModuleInitializer implementations will be triggered upon application startup, in the order following the application module dependency structure (more core ones are invoked first). Also, ApplicationModules exposes a ….getComparator() to order Spring beans that way. Note, that this requires the JGraphT library to be on the classpath (automatically pulled in via the spring-modulith-runtime artifact). See the reference documentation for details.



GH-116 – PublishedEvents now sees events published from asynchronous event listeners, too.



GH-100 – If you’re using AssertJ in your tests, you can now use AssertablePublishedEvents for a more streamlined integration  (for example, assertThat(events).contains(MyEvent.class).matching(…)).



GH-117 – As we incentivize event-based, asynchronous application module integration, the test starter now also pulls in Awaitility.



GH-111 – We now publish aggregated Javdoc.





Find a complete change log in the GitHub release page. We are looking forward to your feedback in the GitHub discussions.]]></summary>

This post warns Devops from a false sense of security. Following security best practices when developing and configuring microservices do not result in non-vulnerable microservices. The post shows that although all deployed microservices are vulnerable, there is much that can be done to ensure microservices are not exploited. It explains how analyzing the behavior of clients and services from a security standpoint, named here "Security-Behavior Analysis", can protect the deployed vulnerable microservices. It points to Guard, an open source project offering security-behavior monitoring and control of Kubernetes microservices presumed vulnerable.

Identifying performance bottlenecks and wasteful computations can be a complex and challenging task, particularly in modern cloud-native environments. 

As the complexity of cloud-native environments increases, so does the need for effective observability solutions. Organizations typically rely on the established three pillars of observability –– metrics, logs, and traces –– to improve the reliability and performance of their applications and infrastructure. While the pillars are valuable for observability, they are not enough on their own.    

In this blog post, we will discuss why continuous profiling signals are a must-have in your observability toolbox, and how they complement metrics, logs, and traces. In addition, we will also discuss why it is crucial to consolidate all four obse…]]></summary>

Why is that anomalous? How come the anomaly score is not higher? Anomaly detection is a valuable machine learning feature used in Elastic Security and Observability. But, oh boy, those numbers can look confusing. If only someone could explain them in clear language. Or, even better, draw a picture.
In Elastic 8.6, we show extra details for anomaly records. These details allow looking behind the curtains of the anomaly scoring algorithm.
We have written about anomaly scoring and normalization in this blog before. The anomaly detection algorithm analyzes time series of data in an online fashion. It identifies trends and periodic patterns on different time scales, such as a day, a week, a month, or a year.

A service is an application that runs forever, reacting to events differently. For example, a website or a web service gets HTTP requests and sends back responses in various formats (HTML, JSON, etc.). For the connectors-python project, we’re pulling work from Elasticsearch, grabbing data from some source to inject into Elasticsearch, and going back to an idling state.
The structure of such a service using modern Python is based on starting a global task via an async function that loops forever and idles when it’s not triggering some work. It’s a pretty straightforward pattern and offers a simple model: whenever something needs to happen in that main function, it’s deferred to another asynchronous task, and life goes on.

Do you know the difference between remote work and distributed teams?

Post-pandemic, a large majority of the global workforce works remotely in one way or another. In fact, an Owl Labs study found that 62% of workers aged 22 to 65 claimed to work remotely at least occasionally.

What you might not know is that experience working remotely doesn’t necessarily translate to working in a fully distributed environment. 

The difference between remote work and distributed work starts at the company level. Companies that are distributed have an ethos that where you do your work doesn’t impact your performance. Working remotely is at the individual level. It is someone choosing, or being allowed, to work a certain way some, or all, of the time. It can be a hard distinction to make, but at Elasti…]]></summary>

In an earlier blog post, Log monitoring and unstructured log data, moving beyond tail -f, we talked about collecting and working with unstructured log data. We learned that it’s very easy to add data to the Elastic Stack. So far the only parsing we did was to extract the timestamp from this data, so older data gets backfilled correctly. 
We also talked about searching this unstructured data toward the end of the blog. While unstructured data can be incredibly useful when combined with full text search functionality, there are cases where we need a little more structure to use the data to answer our questions.

Kubernetes has been widely adopted, and many organizations use it as their de-facto orchestration engine for running workloads that need to be created and deleted frequently.
Therefore, proper scheduling of the pods is key to ensuring that application pods are up and running within the Kubernetes cluster without any issues. This article delves into the use cases around resource management by leveraging the PriorityClass object to protect mission-critical or high-priority pods from getting evicted and making sure that the application pods are up, running, and serving traffic.

Ensuring the disruptions to your applications do not affect its availability isn't a simple
task. Last month's release of Kubernetes v1.26 lets you specify an unhealthy pod eviction policy
for PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs)
to help you maintain that availability during node management operations.
In this article, we will dive deeper into what modifications were introduced for PDBs to
give application owners greater flexibility in managing disruptions.
What problems does this solve?
API-initiated eviction of pods respects PodDisruptionBudgets (PDBs). This means that a requested voluntary disruption

The v1.25 release of Kubernetes introduced an alpha feature to change how a default StorageClass was assigned to a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC).
With the feature enabled, you no longer need to create a default StorageClass first and PVC second to assign the class. Additionally, any PVCs without a StorageClass assigned can be updated later.
This feature was graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.26.
You can read retroactive default StorageClass assignment in the Kubernetes documentation for more details about how to use that,
or you can read on to learn about why the Kubernetes project is making this change.
Why did StorageClass assignment need improvements
Users might already be familiar with a similar feature that assigns default StorageClasses to new PVCs at the …]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26, released last month, introduced an alpha feature that
lets you specify a data source for a PersistentVolumeClaim, even where the source
data belong to a different namespace.
With the new feature enabled, you specify a namespace in the dataSourceRef field of
a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Once Kubernetes checks that access is OK, the new
PersistentVolume can populate its data from the storage source specified in that other
namespace.
Before Kubernetes v1.26, provided your cluster had the AnyVolumeDataSource feature enabled,
you could already provision new volumes from a data source in the same
namespace.
However, that only worked for the data source in the same namespace,
therefore users couldn't provision a PersistentVolume with …]]></summary>

Kubernetes v1.26 includes significant advancements in network traffic engineering with the graduation of
two features (Service internal traffic policy support, and EndpointSlice terminating conditions) to GA,
and a third feature (Proxy terminating endpoints) to beta. The combination of these enhancements aims
to address short-comings in traffic engineering that people face today, and unlock new capabilities for the future.
Traffic Loss from Load Balancers During Rolling Updates
Prior to Kubernetes v1.26, clusters could experience loss of traffic
from Service load balancers during rolling updates when setting the externalTrafficPolicy field to Local.
There are a lot of moving parts at play here so a quick overview of how Kubernetes manages load balancers migh…]]></summary>
