                    <span>AzureFunBytes is a weekly opportunity to learn more about the fundamentals and foundations that make up Azure. It’s a chance for me to understand more about what people across the Azure organization do and how they do it. Every week we get together at 11 AM Pacific on Microsoft LearnTV and learn more about Azure.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Happy new year! I can’t believe we quickly got this far, but we did. This last year’s been insanely busy, and one of the things I’ve most loved is all the opportunities to use Spring Native to build GraalVM-powered architecture-specific native images.

We released Spring Native 0.11, which is fantastic because it features a brand new AOT (ahead-of-time) engine that completely reworks how we transpile Spring Boot applications into GraalVM native images. I’ve been working with GraalVM a lot over the last two years, and this new release is a vast, revolutionary step in the story of Spring Native and a giant leap forward on the journey to Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land in 2022. 

I’ve been tinkering with the new release a lot over the last mont…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doin’? I’m fresh off a fantastic holiday spent with family in Los Angeles, California. Later today, the girls and I will drive home to San Francisco, California. I’ve enjoyed my visits with people here in Los Angeles, especially since it’s our first actual visit to Los Angeles before the pandemic. 

And now, (can you believe it?), we’re staring down the new year. As always, I will do my yearly This Year in Spring roundup, so stay tuned for that below, after our weekly roundup. So, without further ado, here’s the last This Week in Spring recap of 2021.

Key takeaways:

Elastic Security uncovered a stealthy malware campaign that leverages valid code signing certificates to evade detection
A novel malware loader, BLISTER was used to execute second stage malware payloads in-memory and maintain persistence
The identified malware samples have very low or no detections on VirusTotal
Elastic provided layered prevention coverage from this threat out of the box

Overview

The Elastic Security team identified a noteworthy cluster of malicious activity after reviewing our threat prevention telemetry. A valid code signing certificate is used to sign malware to help the attackers remain under the radar of the security community. We also discovered a novel malware loader used in the campaign, which we’ve named BLISTER. The majority of the malware sam…</span>

On behalf of the team and all the contributors, it’s my pleasure to wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and present you a fresh Spring Integration 5.5.7 release.

                    <span>This article explores the different options that Spring Boot developers have for using Javascript and CSS on the client (browser) side of their application. Part of the plan is to explore some Javascript libraries that play well in the traditional server-side-rendered world of Spring web applications. Those libraries tend to have a light touch for the application developer, in the sense that they allow you to completely avoid Javascript, but still have nice a progressive &quot;modern&quot; UI. We also look at some more &quot;pure&quot; Javascript tools and frameworks. It’s kind of a spectrum, so as a TL;DR here is a list of the sample apps, in rough order of low to high Javascript content:

Our ten-year anniversary is just around the corner. As I’m sure you can imagine, a lot has changed since our humble beginnings as a recipe app. For one, we’ve gone from a scrappy startup with our core Elastic Stack to becoming a publicly traded company with a full arsenal of search-powered solutions. 
Since our start, we’ve led with a human-centric approach to our culture and how we grow. It’s so integrated into what we do, it’s a part of our Source Code. 
“At the beginning of defining values for the company, it was difficult to determine what would actually inspire people.” says CEO and founder, Shay Banon when talking about how our Source Code came to be. “We didn’t want our set of values to be bland or common. We wanted it to be multidimensional, so people can find themselves in it. G…</span>

When Colonial Pipeline suffered a massive ransomware attack in early 2021, an internal vulnerability added to the crisis: The company was operating without its top cybersecurity manager. 
The global security workforce needs to grow by 65% to become fully staffed, according to a new study by (ISC)², the world’s largest organization for cybersecurity pros. While modern IT platforms and tools can certainly automate many low-level tasks to help relieve overburdened security teams, chief information security officers must still find better ways to retain existing workers and recruit new ones.  
If they don’t, those unfilled positions represent a significant source of risk, security leaders say. Staff shortages are causing misconfigured systems, oversights in following security procedures, rus…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Karan Singhal, Senior Software Engineer, Google Research  
Federated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  
 However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…</span>

                    <span>Dear Spring community,

It is my pleasure to announce that the first Spring Framework 6.0 milestone release is available from htts://repo.spring.io/milestone now. This initial milestone covers our baseline upgrade efforts, in particular requiring JDK 17+ and migrating to the Jakarta EE 9 APIs; see my recent baseline blog post for the rationale. At the same time, it removes many long-deprecated classes, including several support packages for outdated third-party infrastructure.

For current upgrade notes, please refer to our Upgrading to Spring Framework 6.0 page which we will keep updating. Follow our main branch on GitHub for the latest changes, as we prepare for 6.0 M2 and the corresponding Spring Boot 3.0 M1 release in January. At that point, you will also be able to consume Spring Framework 6.0 through https://start.spring.io/. For the time being, feel free to grab 6.0 M1 from https://repo.spring.io/ and let us know how it goes.

Cheers,
Juergen</span>

                    <span>A financial customer explained his first automation priority in the most visual and understandable way: “I want to paint all of my network devices with the color of the company.” What I like about that analogy is that it clearly describes the first rule for automation: customers must define their golden configurations (the color to paint) to be able to automate configurations and later assess compliance, and remediate any issues accordingly. 
A “golden configuration” usually refers to a Day 1 configuration, and covers the minimal settings needed for a network device to be configured after a fresh network operating system installation. This usually includes common services such as NTP, DNS, AAA, Syslog, SNMP, and ACLs for management connectivity.</span>

Leveraging various tools and pieces of functionality, this blog describes how we have built a scalable cross-region and cross-provider Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) using cross-cluster search (CCS).
This blog will be useful if your Observability data is distributed across deployments, if you have multiple points of entry to view and analyze your data, and if you find yourself hopping from one Kibana instance to another to find the answers you’re looking for.
Supporting customers across multiple providers and regions means we collect and observe data within each region. Technically, we operate each region in a largely stand-alone fashion. Logs, metrics and trace data collected within that region will remain in that region. While this provides the benefits of isolation and security, it can b…</span>

The shortage of tech skills worsened during the pandemic, and the battle to hire and retain top IT talent is only getting more challenging. To close the IT talent gap, more CIOs are looking to expand the skills of their current workforce, according to a recent McKinsey Global Survey.
But effective upskilling and reskilling isn’t simply a matter of paying for IT practitioners to earn certifications in the latest technology. Leaders must decide what options align best with business objectives, specific skills gaps, and rapidly changing learning styles of knowledge workers.
To get a front-line perspective on these issues, we interviewed a group of seasoned IT pros for their insights into how enterprise leaders should approach employee training and reskilling challenges. Here are highlights …</span>

As marketing director of technology for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, it’s no surprise that Colleen Romero is into power tools. But her favorite utility isn’t a jigsaw or cordless drill.
It’s observability technology.
Observability—software that integrates data from various departments and applications —makes it possible to monitor how customers experience the performance of the 350 websites that Romero oversees. On her watch, the tools have spotted some problems before customers notice. 
“We no longer have customers calling us to say our websites are down,” says Romero. “Observability tools let us spot any degradation of performance and identify the root cause so we can address it proactively.”

For a machine learning (ML) algorithm to be effective, useful features must be extracted from (often) large amounts of training data. However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  
 An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …</span>

CIOs are remaking the IT function — no longer will security and developer teams be siloed. 
Recent survey data from 451 Research, part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence, and published by Elastic shows a major shift in who is using application security tools, suggesting that DevSecOps is not just an idea, but a growing reality for IT decision makers.
IT decision-makers allocated application security tools to 48% of development teams in 2020, compared to just 29% in 2015. That’s nearly a two-fold jump. 
According to “The New Security Imperative for CIOs” report by 451 Research, “Opportunities abound for security to become more directly integrated into DevOps efforts, with CIOs leading the charge.” The report continues: “Security teams must become better versed in DevOps practices and tools…</span>

It’s noon as I write this, and I’ve got GSUG joint presentation with Matt Raible later today. Then, tonight at midnight my time to 5 am or 6 am, I’m kicking off a two-day workshop for GOTO! I look forward to seeing ya there! Anyway, we’ve got a lot to cover so let’s dive into it! 


  
Read this first! If you’ve been living under a rock, you may not have heard of the recent Log4J2 vulnerability. If you’re using the default, out-of-the-box Spring Boot logging support, then this does not apply to you! But, if you are using Log4j2, specifically, then you need to read this post on Log4j2 and Spring Boot!

Multi-horizon forecasting, i.e. predicting variables-of-interest at multiple future time steps, is a crucial challenge in time series machine learning. Most real-world datasets have a time component, and forecasting the future can unlock great value. For example, retailers can use future sales to optimize their supply chain and promotions, investment managers are interested in forecasting the future prices of financial assets to maximize their performance, and healthcare institutions can use the number of future patient admissions to have sufficient personnel and equipment.

Tokenization is a fundamental pre-processing step for most natural language processing (NLP) applications. It involves splitting text into smaller units called tokens (e.g., words or word segments) in order to turn an unstructured input string into a sequence of discrete elements that is suitable for a machine learning (ML) model. ln deep learning–based models (e.g., BERT), each token is mapped to an embedding vector to be fed into the model.  
   


Tokenization in a typical deep learning model, like BERT.

   
A fundamental tokenization approach is to break text into words. However, using this approach, words that are not included in the vocabulary are treated as “unknown”.…</span>

Large language models (e.g., GPT-3) have many significant capabilities, such as performing few-shot learning across a wide array of tasks, including reading comprehension and question answering with very few or no training examples. While these models can perform better by simply using more parameters, training and serving these large models can be very computationally intensive. Is it possible to train and use these models more efficiently? 
  
In “GLaM: Efficient Scaling of Language Models with Mixture-of-Experts”, we introduce the Generalist Language Model (GLaM), a trillion weight model that can be trained and served efficiently (in terms of computation and energy use) thanks to sparsity, and achieves…</span>

Scaling neural networks, whether it be the amount of training data used, the model size or the computation being utilized,  has been critical for improving model quality in many real-world machine learning applications, such as computer vision, language understanding and neural machine translation. This, in turn, has motivated recent studies to scrutinize the factors that play a critical role in the success of scaling a neural model. Although increasing model capacity can be a sound approach to improve model quality, doing so presents a number of systems and software engineering challenges that must be overcome. For instance, in order to train large models that exceed the memory capacity of an accel…</span>

Transformer models consistently obtain state-of-the-art results in computer vision tasks, including object detection and video classification. In contrast to standard convolutional approaches that process images pixel-by-pixel, the Vision Transformers (ViT) treat an image as a sequence of patch tokens (i.e., a smaller part, or “patch”, of an image made up of multiple pixels). This means that at every layer, a ViT model recombines and processes patch tokens based on relations between each pair of tokens, using multi-head self-attention. In doing so, ViT models have the capability to construct a global representation of the entire image. 
At the input-level, the tokens are fo…</span>
