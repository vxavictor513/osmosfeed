                <p>Managing virtual machines in an IT infrastructure is often a common task, specifically VMware virtualization technology has been around for over 20 years. VMware administrators spend a lot of their time in automating the creation, management, and removal of virtual instances that contain various operating systems. One operating system that often resides on VMware infrastructure is Red Hat Enterprise Linux.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>We introduced official support for Integrated Storage in HashiCorp Vault 1.4, which allows Vault admins to configure an internal storage option for storing Vault’s persistent data rather than using an external storage backend (via the Raft consensus protocol). With each subsequent Vault release, we have continued to improve the operational experience and we are pleased to announce a highly requested feature called Autopilot in Vault 1.7.

                <p>HashiCorp Terraform uses providers to manage cloud infrastructure, which you define in Terraform configuration files. When learning to use Terraform, practitioners focus on resource blocks, which map to infrastructure that Terraform will manage.
