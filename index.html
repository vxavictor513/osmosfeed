                    <span>While developing Elasticsearch, we occasionally come across an important problem with no simple or established approach to solving it. It&#x27;s natural to ask “hmm, is there an academic paper that addresses this?” Other times, academic work is a source of inspiration. We&#x27;ll encounter a paper proposing a new algorithm or data structure and think “this would be so useful!” Here are just a few examples of how Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene incorporate academic work:

HyperLogLog++ for cardinality aggregations
C3 algorithm for adaptive replica selection
Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) for nearest vector search in Lucene
MIC statistic to improve machine learning classification
Block-max WAND for faster top-hits retrieval in Lucene

Now developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and security analysts can ingest data from Google Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack with just a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console. By leveraging Google Dataflow templates, Elastic makes it easy to stream events and logs from Google Cloud services like Google Cloud Audit, VPC Flow, or firewall into the Elastic Stack. This allows customers to simplify their data pipeline architecture, eliminate operational overhead, and reduce the time required for troubleshooting.

Many developers, SREs, and security analysts who use Google Cloud to develop applications and set up their infrastructure also use the Elastic Stack to troubleshoot, monitor, and …</span>

                    <span>Elastic Observability 7.15 introduces the general availability of automated correlations, unified views across application service logs and dependencies, and agentless log ingestion from Google Cloud Platform (GCP), accelerating troubleshooting of root causes of application issues and making it even easier to ingest telemetry from cloud services. 

These new features allow customers to:

Automatically surface attributes of the APM data set that are correlated with high-latency or erroneous transactions
Effortlessly troubleshoot application issues by viewing all associated application or service logs from within the APM user interface 
Seamlessly ingest log data into Elastic from within the Google Cloud console and extend monitoring to native Google Cloud services

                    <span>Elastic Security 7.15 further arms the SOC to achieve extended detection and response (XDR). 
Malicious behavior protection applies behavior analytics to prevent attack techniques often leveraged by named threats by performing dynamic, stateful correlation of on-host events, and then reacting instantly to disrupt attacks before they cause damage.
Memory threat protection now safeguards Windows hosts, stopping attacks designed to evade most other defenses.
To accelerate response and prevent damage and loss, 7.15 adds host isolation for cloud-native Linux systems, making the capability now available on every OS protected by Elastic Agent. 
Let’s dive in.
