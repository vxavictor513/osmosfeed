                    <span>Hiya! With Elastic’s expansion of our Elasticsearch Service Cloud offering and automated onboarding, we’ve expanded the Elastic Stack audience from full ops teams to data engineers, security teams, and consultants. As an Elastic support rep, I’ve enjoyed interacting with more user backgrounds and with even wider use cases. 

With a wider audience, I’m seeing more questions about managing resource allocation, in particular the mystical shard-heap ratio and avoiding circuit breakers. I get it! When I started …</span>

                    <span>Our journey with Elastic began with a search for a single monitoring platform service for all kinds of applications and infrastructure across geographies and in the cloud. Like many other organizations who use Elastic, our story does not end there.  
 Instead, it has evolved to support new use cases and to secure us a managed security service provider partnership (MSSP) with Elastic so that we can help our own customers experience the same digital transformation success we’ve realized along the way.
