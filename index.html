                    <span>In today’s containerized world, it’s common to encounter similar issues with known solutions across multiple pods. For most people there are 2 solutions: go pod-by-pod finding and fixing the problem, or do that while also spending months trying to automate that process. This is significant time and manual labor.

                    <span>As we’ve shown in a previous blog, search-based detection rules and Elastic’s machine learning-based anomaly detection can be a powerful way to identify rare and unusual activity in cloud API logs. Now, as of Elastic Security 7.13, we’ve introduced a new set of unsupervised machine learning jobs for network data, and accompanying alert rules, several of which look for geographic anomalies. In this blog post, we’ll explore a case study demonstrating how network data can yield important detections. 

Before the advent of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security teams relied heavily on network instrumentation like firewall logs and intrusion detection (IDS) alerts. Given the lack of process information or user context, in network logs, the false positive rate for network events c…</span>

                    <span>Hiya! Our Elasticsearch team is continually improving our index Lifecycle Management (ILM) feature. When I first joined Elastic Support, I quickly got up to speed via our Automate rollover with ILM tutorial. I noticed after helping multiple users set up ILM that escalations mainly emerge from a handful of configuration issues. 

In the following sections, I’d like to cover frequent tickets, diagnostic flow, and common error recoveries. All commands shown can be run via Kibana’s Dev Tools.
 
Configure

The ILM backend process runs by default but requires user configuration to affect indices. You can verify ILM is running via ILM status returning operation_mode:RUNNING.

                    <span>One of Rain Hu&#x27;s favorite moments of the day is her early morning run. &quot;I run six kilometers minimum daily, rain or shine,&quot; she says. &quot;I enjoy the time alone because it allows me to have time for self-reflection and self-conversation.&quot;

The discipline that it takes to maintain a healthy lifestyle is carried throughout her life. As a wife, mother of two young boys, and sales leader, Rain optimizes her time so that she can show up fully and authentically in all aspects of her life.

We sat down with Rain, Regional Vice President of Sales (ASEAN and Hong Kong) at Elastic, to learn how she has built a career she loves. Read on to learn about how she grew her career in tech sales and what advice she has for others looking to do the same.

                    <span>In my previous blog post, I demonstrated how to use Prometheus and Fluentd with the Elastic Stack to monitor Kubernetes. That’s a good option if you’re already using those open source-based monitoring tools in your organization. But, if you’re new to Kubernetes monitoring, or want to take full advantage of Elastic Observability, there is an easier and more comprehensive way. In this blog, we will explore how to monitor Kubernetes the Elastic way: using Filebeat and Metricbeat.
Using Filebeat and Metricbeat

                    <span>Detecting and preventing malicious activity such as botnet attacks is a critical area of focus for threat intel analysts, security operators, and threat hunters. Taking up the Mozi botnet as a case study, this blog post demonstrates how to use open source tools, analytical processes, and the Elastic Stack to perform analysis and enrichment of collected data irrespective of the campaign. This will allow you to take the lessons and processes outlined below to your organization and apply them to your specific use cases.

The Mozi botnet has been leveraging vulnerable Internet of Things (IoT) devices to launch campaigns that can take advantage of the force multiplication provided by a botnet (Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS), email spam, brute-force, password spraying, etc.). Mozi was firs…</span>

                    <span>TL;DR - head over to spring.io/survey to take the State of Spring 2021 survey! You can also RT this tweet and help spread the word! Thank you &lt;3


We ran the State of Spring survey last year, and it was a huge success. Spring community members across the globe, like you, shared their views and experiences, and it all made for fantastic reading.

The survey is back this year, and we want to hear from you! How can Spring help you build new apps and experiences this year? What would you like us to change? This year, we have new sections on Spring Native, building &amp; sharing APIs internally/externally, and a deeper dive on Data.

In exchange for 15 minutes of your time taking the survey, you’ll be among the first to receive our report and the insights included in it. 

Sounds good? Head over to spring.io/survey now! The survey will close at the end of July. 

Do consider helping us share the survey by retweeting this post on Spring Central twitter, and thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us!

                    <span>Is enterprise data a benefit or a burden?

Think about all of the data your organization generates and consumes in the digital age — from security event logs to application error messages, energy consumption to vendor contracts. There is so much, and all of it is usually stored in silos, making the data difficult to synthesize to provide better services, identify signals proactively, or make stronger business decisions. How do organizations overcome the challenges of understanding their data so that they can finally derive value from it, allowing organizations to truly put their data to work? 

The answer is to shift your organization’s thinking away from the complexity of consolidating data to how to better find the answers within it. More data can mean more insights, and those benefits h…</span>

                    <span>This is a short and sweet, to-the-point, tutorial series that shows how to add search functionality to an iOS app using Elasticsearch for free! More specifically, in this two-part blog series, we will be creating an iOS app that uses Elastic App Search for searching a movie database. By the end of this tutorial, whether you need to search through a small movie database or through petabytes of cloud metrics, you’ll have the knowledge you need to build an amazing search experience for iOS mobile users.

                    <span>In a previous blog, we discussed how to monitor, troubleshoot, and fix high %CPU issues. We also revealed a system API that could have an unexpected impact on CPU consumption. In this episode, we’ll discuss another time-related performance aspect that is unique to security software: application startup time. You don’t need to be a developer to benefit from this article. As long as you are curious to find out how the applications in your environment perform and why sometimes they seem to be very slow and want to improve that, you might find this blog post helpful.
 
What is application startup time?

Security software usually sits along the critical path an application takes when it is about to launch or execute. The software makes the decision either to block or allow the launching/executi…</span>

                    <span>Users of Elastic Security are protected through numerous layers of protections against the REvil ransomware that affected Kaseya VSA and its customers. Elastic Security’s layered protections prevented 100% of the REvil ransomware samples tested before damage and loss could occur to the business.

We believe that detections and preventions must be layered, as no single protection works 100% of the time. There are times where detection in the SIEM/central analytics layer is the most effective, especially when you need to take signals from multiple places or correlate the activity to determine it is malicious. However, the most effective way to stop an attack is at the host. 

Prevention is paramount when it comes to ransomware. Teams cannot wait to be notified of an issue after their data is…</span>
