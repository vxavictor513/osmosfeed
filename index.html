                    <span>Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management, and seems to have established itself as the de facto standard in this area these days. The shift from monolithic applications to microservices brought by Kubernetes has enabled faster deployment, where dynamic environments become commonplace. But on the other hand, this has made monitoring applications and their underpinning infrastructure more complex. Fortunately, Elastic has been widely used for infrastructure and application monitoring solutions for many years — both as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and more recently as Elastic Observability.

                    <span>We all want to work for a company where we fit in. That’s why Elastic built a Source Code that encourages all to come as they are. In this Pride blog series, we highlight LGBTQIA+ Elasticians who have a unique story — one, perhaps, just as unique as yours. 
 David Ricordel, a consulting architect based in Barcelona, says: “If we bring more diverse people to our companies, it’s a way to allow people to feel safe being who they are.” Being safe, in turn, helps Elasticians focus their energy on work and growing as professionals. 
 
When did you realize that Elastic placed importance on diversity, equity, and inclusion?

                    <span>Even before COVID-19 forced nearly everyone to grapple with virtual work, most organizations had mountains of content scattered across numerous teams and dozens, if not hundreds, of apps. But now new research shows the cost of poor employee experiences for organizations: productivity, confidence, and opportunity.

While blended work environments are likely here to stay, 58% of 1,000 US-based knowledge workers surveyed by Wakefield Research on behalf of Elastic say searching for documents is a top work-from-home problem. Moreover, 81% say they have a hard time finding documents when a boss or client has put them in the hot seat. As employers forge new paths for growth in the post-pandemic era, and demand for a distributed work model persists, business leaders must better empower workers to …</span>

Software performance issues come in all shapes and sizes. Therefore, performance tuning includes many aspects and subareas, and has to adopt a broad range of methodologies and techniques. Despite all this, time is one of the most critical measurements of software performance. 

In this multi-part series, I’ll focus on a few of the time-related aspects of software performance — particularly for security software. Each post in this series will focus on a single topic, including how to identify performance issues, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in future.

Motivation

Imagine that you are using Elasticsearch to power a search application for finding books, and in this application you want to treat the following words as synonyms:

brainstorm
brainstorming
brainstormed
brain storm
brain storming
brain stormed
envisage
envisaging
envisaged
etc.
It is tedious and error prone to explicitly use synonyms to define all possible conjugations, declensions, and inflections of a word or of a compound word.

However, it is possible to reduce the size of the list of synonyms by making use of a …</span>

This week was no exception. I joined the my buddy Matt Raible and Brian Demeers today for the OktaDev Twitch channel and we hacked on making the Spring Boot starter for Okta work with Spring Native. The goal is that you should be able to bring your application unchanged with Spring Native, and this is yet another example of that working. We didn’t know what issues we were going to face, but we managed to figure out the relatively minor things required to make it work within an hour and within two hours we had most a working, standalone “hints” .jar dependency that users can add to their spring-aot plugins dependencies. Hopefully they…</span>

We accomplished our goal and reduced the overall time it takes users to go from a blank slate to a meaningful dashboard that conveys insights about the data. 
 In this post, I’m going to explain the technical concepts behind these improvements, and how they work to create a user-friendly and efficient dashboard creation process. My hope for this post is that it helps inform the mental models of our curious power users while they attempt to learn these new dashboard creation flows.

                    <span>As organizations migrate to Elastic from incumbent vendors, quickly onboarding log data from their current solution into Elastic is one of the first orders of business. Data onboarding often involves having to adjust ingestion architecture and implement configuration changes across data sources. We want to ensure that users trialing or migrating to Elastic can get data in quickly to start seeing the power of Elastic solutions as quickly as possible. That’s why we built an integration that automatically maps Splunk-ingested data to Elastic Common Schema (ECS). 
 In this blog post, we’ll be walking you through this experimental Splunk integration, released in version 7.12 of the Elastic Stack. This integration allows you to keep your Splunk universal forwarders and other Splunk ingest techno…</span>

                    <span>The University of California at Davis is an agriculturally focused university of more than 30,000 students. Founded in 1905, the university performs federally funded research for the U.S. Department of Defense, U.S. Department of Agriculture, and other agencies. It’s also home to  an electric power substation, police and fire departments, and even an airport. 

All of this combined is a digital security challenge for Jeff Rowe, the university’s cybersecurity architect. There are 5,000 servers, and the university&#x27;s Security Operations Center monitors 170,000 user accounts for cybersecurity threats originating across the globe.

With this level of complexity, UC Davis needed to enhance its security even more. The first step for the university was to centralize security logs in one place by e…</span>

                    <span>TL;DR: We recommend that you use the new point-in-time functionality in Elasticsearch if you can. The scroll API is no longer recommended for deep pagination (even though it still works).
Most data is constantly changing. When querying an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially searching for data at a given point of time. With an index that is constantly changing — as in most observability and security use cases — two identical queries performed at two different times will return different results because the data has changed over time. So, what do you do if you need to remove that time variable?
The point in time (PIT) reader, which was introduced in Elasticsearch 7.10, gives you the ability to repeatedly query an index as it was at a specific point in time.

Decisions that need to be made in an instant require answers in real time, but existing big data systems are unable to return queries quickly enough for real-time analytics. And with growing data being queried by more connected users than ever before, it’s getting increasingly challenging to maintain fast reaction times. 

The DoD Data Strategy approaches this challenge by providing a blueprint for how data should be managed and accessed by the services, ensuring that trusted information gets to the right destinations at the right time.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doing? I’m silly stoked! This week saw the release of Spring Native 0.10.0 and it is awesome! You absolutely have to check this release out. I put together an episode of Spring Tips, the most comprehensive of its kind, introducing (almost) everything you’ll need to know about Spring Native and Spring Native 0.10.0 in particular. Start here. Spring Native is awesome and this is the comprehensive introduction I wish I’d had at the start. 

The next time we meet in this humble column, next week, will be June 22nd, and by then we’ll have passed summer solstice - the longest day in the year! - and the beginning of summer. Farewell (for now) to Spring, the season, and long live Spring, the easiest and most productive path to production for your applications. 

Anyway, my friends, we’ve got a ton of things to look at this week, starting of course with that Spring Native video and release announcement, of course, so let’s get to it! 


  
In this week’s installment of Spring Tips, I look at Spring Native 0.10.0, available now.

                    <span>I hate reinventing the wheel once I find a good setup. On top of that, I dislike searching for all the links I used to come up with the “ultimate setup” for different services. So, I decided to outline for myself (and for you of course) my default setup when I deploy on Elastic Cloud to set myself up for success and automate insight for the future. Most of my setup steps make monitoring accessible or automate various warnings to myself.

                    <span>Security teams defending Windows environments often rely on anti-malware products as a first line of defense against malicious executables. Microsoft provides security vendors with the ability to register callbacks that will be invoked upon the creation of processes on the system. Driver developers can call APIs such as PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx to receive such events.

Despite the name, PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx callbacks are not actually invoked upon the creation of processes, but rather upon the creation of the first threads within those processes. This creates a gap between when a process is created and when security products are notified of its creation. It also gives malware authors a window to tamper with the backing executable before security products can scan it. R…</span>

There are many tools available for running adversary emulation plans and performing purple team exercises. This blog will focus on how teams can use Prelude Operator in conjunction with Elastic Security.

At Elastic, we’ve been working closely with the team at Prelude as we have a very similar mission — we want to help security teams of all skill levels, arming all analysts and red teams alike. We want to protect the world’s da…</span>

                    <span>Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) is an easy way to get the Elastic Stack up and running on top of Kubernetes. That’s because ECK automates the deployment, provisioning, management, and setup of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and more. 

As logging and metric data — or time series data — has a predictable lifespan, you can use hot, warm, and cold architecture to easily manage your data over time as it ages and becomes less relevant.

In this guide, we’ll explain how to set up SAML with auth0 as an identity provider (IdP) as well as how to configure your deployment for hot-warm-cold architecture with ECK. We’ll use production features such as:

Zone awareness
Pod and node affinity
PodDisruption
Dedicated storage class

It’s one of those weeks where, even though the thing I wanted to happen - a vacation with the family - didn’t happen, what did happen - accidentally lots of free time with no meetings - has turned out wonderfully. It was all I could do to pry myself from the IDE to pull together this week’s roundup, but I am glad I did! There’s a ton of great stuff there. Let’s dive into it.

                    <span>Dear Spring Community,



Today it’s my pleasure to announce releases of Spring Integration for Amazon Web Services extension versions 2.5.1 and Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0.



These releases can be downloaded from Maven Central:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-aws:2.5.1&#x27;




If you don’t use Kinesis Binder.
Or via Binder dependency:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis:2.2.0&#x27;




Spring Integration for AWS extension of 2.5.1 has some minor bug fixes after the previous 2.5.0 announcement.



The Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0 is the first release in the project generation which is based on a new independent Spring Cloud for AWS artifact. It also was upgraded to the latest Spring Cloud 2020.0.3 and has some other bug fixes and improvements.



Any feedback is welcome via all the available communication channels!
