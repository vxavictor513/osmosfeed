Before we look into our different use cases, it helps to get a high-level understanding of Adyen’s architecture.

At Adyen, we do many things, but the core of what we do is payment processing. Our payment platform is built for any business and every customer journey. We process payments across all sales channels.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How’re you doing? I’m still fresh off my little vacation last week, feeling fantastic. I’ve spent the last several days working with Spring Boot and Spring Native and I have to tell you, they’re epic.

It’s hard to know what the right comparison is. There’s not much you can do in this life that results in such an instantaneous, night-and-day difference in performance and memory profile with so few (user-visibile) changes.

                    <span>When automating processes you typically integrate systems and services, or in other words you orchestrate various APIs. In order to achieve this you not only have different technical possibilities, but also can choose between various modeling possibilities in BPMN. This post will give you an overview and advice on how to decide between alternatives.

                    <span>Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) are interfaces that enable multiple software applications to send and retrieve data from one another. They are commonly used for retrieving, saving, editing, or deleting data from databases, transmitting data between apps, and embedding third-party services into apps. The company BaseTen helps companies build and deploy machine learning APIs and applications.

                    <span>Greetings Spring community,



The Spring Web Services team has released 3.1.1. This is the first major release under the new versioning schema. Releases will no longer have .RELEASE and snapshots will only be -SNAPSHOT, to better comply with community approaches.



While we strive to maintain alignment with Spring Framework and Spring Security, we also test against Java 8, Java 11, and Java LATEST (JDK 16 as of today).



For more details, read the following release notes for each version:



Release Notes - Spring Web Services - Version 3.1.1.





#1198 - Test against JDK 16 on CI.



#1197 - Upgrade to Spring Framework 5.3.7.



#1187 - Upgrade to Spring Security 5.5.0.



#1199 - Don’t skip main build targets during releases.

                    <span>Camunda Platform Run, or Camunda Run for short, is a lightweight distribution of Camunda Platform that works straight out-of-the-box and comes pre-configured for production environments. Camunda Run is an excellent option if you’re just getting started with Camunda, or if you’re ready to use Camunda Platform in production. You can download the open-source Community Edition for free, and easily upgrade to the Enterprise Edition to access more features and support options. After you download and extract Camunda Run, you’ll find a configuration folder that contains a file called production.yml. The properties defined in this file are important for production environments and are derived from our guide to securing your Camunda Platform installation. To start Camunda Run with the production.yml configuration,...

On behalf of the team and all the contributors, it’s my pleasure to announce a General Availability for Spring Integration 5.5, plus Spring Integration 5.4.7 patch release.



Both versions can be obtained from Maven Central and it is recommended to upgrade your projects or just pull them transitively from respective latest Spring Boot patch versions!

Spring Integration 5.4.7 version contains mostly critical bug fixes and here is a highlight of notable changes made to Spring Integration 5.5, which, in general, is based on the community feedback to make the framework useful for end-user use-cases:

                    <span>It has been just over two years since we introduced the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), and what a journey it’s been. From categorization fields to request for comments to Threat Intelligence fields, ECS has evolved rapidly over the course of the last two years. In this blog post, I would like to reflect on the ECS journey so far, and look towards the future of ECS. 
 You may by now be well experienced with ECS as a specification that provides a consistent and customizable way to structure your data in Elasticsearch, facilitating the analysis of data from diverse sources. With ECS, analytics content such as dashboards and machine learning jobs can be applied more broadly, searches can be crafted more narrowly, and field names are easier to remember.

                    <span>When it comes to malware attacks, one of the more common techniques is “living off the land” (LOtL). Utilizing standard tools or features that already exist in the target environment allows these attacks to blend into the environment and avoid detection. While these techniques can appear normal in isolation, they start looking suspicious when observed in the parent-child context. This is where the ProblemChild framework can help. 

In this blog, we will talk about how you can use Elastic machine learning to create your own ProblemChild framework to detect LOtL activity in Windows process event data (we will be referring to Windows process events as just “events” throughout this blog). We will talk in detail about the following:

If so, do any of these problems sound familiar? The software was hard to install, and we need specialized knowledge to maintain it We haven’t been able to fully integrate the software with other parts of our tech stack It’s hard to find developers who know how to make the software do what we need it to do Our developers have to work around the software’s technical or functional limitations These problems stem from the fact that many BPM suites are built on a closed architecture and take a proprietary approach to application development and process automation.

                    <span>Red Hat Ansible Engine v2.9 introduced the first set of Resource Modules that make network automation easier and more consistent, especially in multi-vendor environments. These network resource specific and opinionated Ansible modules help us avoid creating overly complex Jinja2 templates to render and push network configurations, thereby easing the adoption of network automation both in green and brownfield environments. The resource modules, along with the tools provided in ansible.utils, are highly focused on allowing the end user to manipulate network configuration as “structured data” and not have to worry about network platform specific details.</span>

“Sometimes people teased her about her accent, but she was always so proud. She didn’t care. Her accent was her own. I have always looked for places that allow me to have my own accent as well. It hasn’t always been easy,” said Nikko.
He began his career in IT when he got a job in retail at an Apple store to support himself while pursuing a degree in child and adolescent development. Eventually, he was promoted to an internal corporate tech support role. As his mom taught him, he kept focusing on how his experiences could help him stand out and achieve more.…</span>

From our early days as a lightweight Java project, we’ve relentlessly innovated — engineering an end-to-end Process Automation tech stack that has helped organizations across the globe automate mission-critical processes. But innovation never stops and organizations continue to look for new ways to increase the velocity of business transformation. To address this need, more and more organizations are turning to the cloud, which is increasingly becoming a business transformation accelerator.  That being said, as enterprise applications are being built entirely in the cloud, organizations are struggling with automating processes across multiple systems, people, and devices in an end-to-end manner. These processes often include modern components...

                    <span>Red Hat Ansible Network Automation continues to be a popular domain for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform. We have continually developed additional resource modules to make automating network appliances easier, and more approachable, for novices and experts alike. These resource modules provide a consistent experience across multiple network vendors. There are seven main state parameters for resource modules: merged, replaced, overridden, deleted, gathered, rendered and parsed. The Ansible network team is adding one more parameter, purged, to this tool chest for resource modules. This blog will cover the purged parameter and show use-cases through a practical example.</span>
