                    <span>Happy New Year, Spring community!



Hope you had great holidays and ready for new excitements in front of us.



After the rest and recharging during Christmas break I decided to pay honor to my favorite language back in days - Groovy.



And now it’s my pleasure to present you a brand new Groovy DSL for Spring Integration.
You perhaps heard about our old attempt to make a Groovy DSL on top of Spring Integration XML support.
But the solution was pretty cumbersome (especially for protocol-specific channel adapters) and support burden has grown tremendously.
This my latest implementation is fully based on already mature Java DSL and its builder pattern support.



Having 10 years experience with Gradle I thought that it is going be easy enough for me to prepare quickly someth…</span>

                    <span>The Spring Framework 5.3.14 and 5.2.19 releases on December 16 included fixes for CVE-2021-22060 and are a follow-up to CVE-2021-22096, to address additional types of input that can cause the issue. As the Spring Boot releases 2.6.2 and 2.5.8 picking up these Spring Framework versions were due the day before Christmas and given the medium severity, we postponed the announcement until after the new year, to avoid disclosure during a period when many take time off. Please, upgrade to those latest maintenance releases.</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring, the first in the new year! (Happy new year!) This week also marks the 11th anniversary of This Week in Spring, which I started writing on the first Tuesday of January 2011 thanks to a great idea from SpringSource co-founder and all-around good-guy Keith Donald (@kdonald). 

What a run! As always, I just wanna extend a heartfelt thanks to all of you who read (_suffer!_) my rambling writing every week. We’ve been lucky, as a community, to have presided over the most amazing and uplifting period in Spring and the JVM’s history… This roundup has reflected that with incredible stuff happening all the time.

Government data strategies lay a promising groundwork for how data will be used to drive more informed decision making internally and more streamlined public services externally. A commonality between these strategies is the need for improved role-based data sharing and data re-use. The sticking point, however, is in the way to implement data sharing when there are known silos across and within various departments. More often than not, these silos exist for good reason, particularly for data privacy compliance requirements.
How can these hurdles be overcome and the promise of data sharing across government departments be realized?

With the Elastic 7.16 release, Osquery Manager is now generally available for Elastic Agent, making it easier than ever to deploy and run Osquery across your environments. By collecting Osquery data and combining it with the power of the Elastic Stack, you can greatly expand your endpoint telemetry, enabling enhanced detection and investigation, and improved hunting for vulnerabilities and anomalous activities.
This blog post gives a brief intro to the Osquery Manager integration for Elastic Agent ​​and how it can be used in conjunction with Elastic Security. Included are examples that show how to operationalize the Osquery data with use cases such as building critical security alerts, querying isolated hosts during investigations, and monitoring for anomalous host activities with ML det…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Happy new year! I can’t believe we quickly got this far, but we did. This last year’s been insanely busy, and one of the things I’ve most loved is all the opportunities to use Spring Native to build GraalVM-powered architecture-specific native images.

We released Spring Native 0.11, which is fantastic because it features a brand new AOT (ahead-of-time) engine that completely reworks how we transpile Spring Boot applications into GraalVM native images. I’ve been working with GraalVM a lot over the last two years, and this new release is a vast, revolutionary step in the story of Spring Native and a giant leap forward on the journey to Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land in 2022.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doin’? I’m fresh off a fantastic holiday spent with family in Los Angeles, California. Later today, the girls and I will drive home to San Francisco, California. I’ve enjoyed my visits with people here in Los Angeles, especially since it’s our first actual visit to Los Angeles before the pandemic. 

And now, (can you believe it?), we’re staring down the new year. As always, I will do my yearly This Year in Spring roundup, so stay tuned for that below, after our weekly roundup. So, without further ado, here’s the last This Week in Spring recap of 2021.

On behalf of the team and all the contributors, it’s my pleasure to wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and present you a fresh Spring Integration 5.5.7 release.



It can be obtained from Maven Central and it is recommended to upgrade your projects or just pull it transitively from respective latest Spring Boot patch version!

The notable changes and important bug fixes are:

It is likely in the next major 6.0 version we will rename it to GROUP_CONDITION.

I’ve set my out-of-office status and am already winding down for the year. You can expect new episodes of This Week in Spring and a Bootiful Podcast (@BootifulPodcast), of course, but I won’t be doing any new Spring Tips (@SpringTipsLive) videos until next year.

                    <span>This article explores the different options that Spring Boot developers have for using Javascript and CSS on the client (browser) side of their application. Part of the plan is to explore some Javascript libraries that play well in the traditional server-side-rendered world of Spring web applications. Those libraries tend to have a light touch for the application developer, in the sense that they allow you to completely avoid Javascript, but still have nice a progressive &quot;modern&quot; UI. We also look at some more &quot;pure&quot; Javascript tools and frameworks. It’s kind of a spectrum, so as a TL;DR here is a list of the sample apps, in rough order of low to high Javascript content:

Our ten-year anniversary is just around the corner. As I’m sure you can imagine, a lot has changed since our humble beginnings as a recipe app. For one, we’ve gone from a scrappy startup with our core Elastic Stack to becoming a publicly traded company with a full arsenal of search-powered solutions. 
Since our start, we’ve led with a human-centric approach to our culture and how we grow. It’s so integrated into what we do, it’s a part of our Source Code. 
“At the beginning of defining values for the company, it was difficult to determine what would actually inspire people.” says CEO and founder, Shay Banon when talking about how our Source Code came to be. “We didn’t want our set of values to be bland or common. We wanted it to be multidimensional, so people can find themselves in it. G…</span>

When Colonial Pipeline suffered a massive ransomware attack in early 2021, an internal vulnerability added to the crisis: The company was operating without its top cybersecurity manager. 
The global security workforce needs to grow by 65% to become fully staffed, according to a new study by (ISC)², the world’s largest organization for cybersecurity pros. While modern IT platforms and tools can certainly automate many low-level tasks to help relieve overburdened security teams, chief information security officers must still find better ways to retain existing workers and recruit new ones.  
If they don’t, those unfilled positions represent a significant source of risk, security leaders say. Staff shortages are causing misconfigured systems, oversights in following security procedures, rus…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Karan Singhal, Senior Software Engineer, Google Research  
Federated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  
 However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr…</span>

                    <span>Dear Spring community,

It is my pleasure to announce that the first Spring Framework 6.0 milestone release is available from htts://repo.spring.io/milestone now. This initial milestone covers our baseline upgrade efforts, in particular requiring JDK 17+ and migrating to the Jakarta EE 9 APIs; see my recent baseline blog post for the rationale. At the same time, it removes many long-deprecated classes, including several support packages for outdated third-party infrastructure.

For current upgrade notes, please refer to our Upgrading to Spring Framework 6.0 page which we will keep updating. Follow our main branch on GitHub for the latest changes, as we prepare for 6.0 M2 and the corresponding Spring Boot 3.0 M1 release in January. At that point, you will also be able to consume Spring Framework 6.0 through https://start.spring.io/. For the time being, feel free to grab 6.0 M1 from https://repo.spring.io/ and let us know how it goes.

Cheers,
Juergen</span>

                    <span>A financial customer explained his first automation priority in the most visual and understandable way: “I want to paint all of my network devices with the color of the company.” What I like about that analogy is that it clearly describes the first rule for automation: customers must define their golden configurations (the color to paint) to be able to automate configurations and later assess compliance, and remediate any issues accordingly. 
A “golden configuration” usually refers to a Day 1 configuration, and covers the minimal settings needed for a network device to be configured after a fresh network operating system installation. This usually includes common services such as NTP, DNS, AAA, Syslog, SNMP, and ACLs for management connectivity.</span>

Leveraging various tools and pieces of functionality, this blog describes how we have built a scalable cross-region and cross-provider Single Pane of Glass (SPOG) using cross-cluster search (CCS).
This blog will be useful if your Observability data is distributed across deployments, if you have multiple points of entry to view and analyze your data, and if you find yourself hopping from one Kibana instance to another to find the answers you’re looking for.
Supporting customers across multiple providers and regions means we collect and observe data within each region. Technically, we operate each region in a largely stand-alone fashion. Logs, metrics and trace data collected within that region will remain in that region. While this provides the benefits of isolation and security, it can b…</span>

The shortage of tech skills worsened during the pandemic, and the battle to hire and retain top IT talent is only getting more challenging. To close the IT talent gap, more CIOs are looking to expand the skills of their current workforce, according to a recent McKinsey Global Survey.
But effective upskilling and reskilling isn’t simply a matter of paying for IT practitioners to earn certifications in the latest technology. Leaders must decide what options align best with business objectives, specific skills gaps, and rapidly changing learning styles of knowledge workers.
To get a front-line perspective on these issues, we interviewed a group of seasoned IT pros for their insights into how enterprise leaders should approach employee training and reskilling challenges. Here are highlights …</span>

As marketing director of technology for Stanley Black &amp; Decker, it’s no surprise that Colleen Romero is into power tools. But her favorite utility isn’t a jigsaw or cordless drill.
It’s observability technology.
Observability—software that integrates data from various departments and applications —makes it possible to monitor how customers experience the performance of the 350 websites that Romero oversees. On her watch, the tools have spotted some problems before customers notice. 
“We no longer have customers calling us to say our websites are down,” says Romero. “Observability tools let us spot any degradation of performance and identify the root cause so we can address it proactively.”
Observability enables businesses and IT teams to trace customer issues back to an offending applica…</span>

For a machine learning (ML) algorithm to be effective, useful features must be extracted from (often) large amounts of training data. However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  
 An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset …</span>

Multi-horizon forecasting, i.e. predicting variables-of-interest at multiple future time steps, is a crucial challenge in time series machine learning. Most real-world datasets have a time component, and forecasting the future can unlock great value. For example, retailers can use future sales to optimize their supply chain and promotions, investment managers are interested in forecasting the future prices of financial assets to maximize their performance, and healthcare institutions can use the number of future patient admissions to have sufficient personnel and equipment. 
  
Deep neural networks (DNNs) have increasingly been used in multi-horizon forecasting, demonstrating strong perform…</span>

                    <span>Recently, I did a live streaming session for the New York City Microsoft Reactor in which I took concepts from the Quickstart: Deploy Bicep files by using GitHub Actions doc and put them into action.  In this session I create an Azure Kubernetes (AKS) cluster with secrets from Azure Key Vault with Bicep and GitHub Actions.
