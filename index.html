                    <span>Falsehoods, spin and legends can be tweaked and tested and changed to exactly match the dreams and desires of the people they’re aimed at. This is why manipulative stories are so much stickier than what really happened. What reality has in its favor is that it’s generally resilient. Gravity doesn’t care who believes in it. […]</span>

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring Shell 2.1.0-M2 has been released and is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

We previously had a milestone M1, named 3.0.0-M1 which we soon after its release realised that it was a mistake to pump major version for this rework to make codebase better for Spring Boot 2.x. We want to avoid confusing versioning when spring-shell upgrades and baselines with Spring Boot 3.x. Thus having said that, Spring Shell 2.1.x is going to be for Spring Boot 2.6.x and future Spring Shell 3.x for Spring Boot 3.x.

Notable changes include:


  
New build-in version command

  
Starter for jna integration

  
Customizer for non-interactive runner

  
New styling and theming subsystem


Please see the release notes for more details.

Thanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests.
How can you help?

As businesses accelerate digital transformations and cloud adoption to better serve customers and employees in the face of the global pandemic, operational complexity has also mounted. To untangle these complexities  and enable executive visibility into IT ecosystem , business leaders are increasingly looking to observability solutions as a strategic investment. 
1. Observability is a critical business initiative,
With customers and employees increasingly going digital, businesses need to innovate faster with increased adoption of cloud and cloud-native technologies. Keeping cloud applications running effectively has also become significantly more difficult. Organizations continue to struggle with a lot of data, but few are able to extract actionable insights.

I bet we all have heard so much about eBPF in recent years. Data shows that eBPF is quickly becoming the first choice for implementing tracing and security applications, and Elastic is also working relentlessly on supercharging our security solutions (and more) with eBPF.

At Elastic we are committed to offering our customers the most secure way to run their workloads in the cloud. To help ensure this commitment, we have migrated our Elastic Cloud Transport Layer Security (TLS) certificates to Let’s Encrypt to best support sustainable and fully automated certificate management as our product offerings and available regions continue to expand.
To achieve this change, we have built a fully automated regional ACM (ACME Certificate Manager). We will walk you through our internal process of why we needed to upgrade, what options we explored, the implementation, and how we use our own Elastic Uptime Monitoring and Kibana to monitor the certificates.

There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-rc2 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).
We’d love to get your feedback and tips on any bugs you find through our Pioneer Program. To become an Elastic Pioneer, try out the preview of any (preferably, every) part of the Elastic Stack and open issues as you find them in the appropriate repo — Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and APM. When you open an issue, mention that you found the bug in 8.0.0-rc2, and we’ll add a “Pioneer Program” label.
If you have questions about preparing for your upgrade to 8.0, visit our forums or community Slack channel, and we’d be happy to help!

Karen Penn credits her career evolution with her lack of patience.
The former government lawyer found herself appreciative of the chance to shape DEI policy at a Department of Defense component agency. But it was slow going.
“My analogy is trying to turn an aircraft carrier around on a lake.

People can flexibly maneuver objects in their physical surroundings to accomplish various goals. One of the grand challenges in robotics is to successfully train robots to do the same, i.e., to develop a general-purpose robot capable of performing a multitude of tasks based on arbitrary user commands. Robots that are faced with the real world will also inevitably encounter new user instructions and situations that were not seen during training. Therefore, it is imperative for robots to be trained to perform multiple tasks in a variety of situations and, more importantly, to be capable of solving new tasks as requested by human users, even if the robot was not explicitly trained on those t…</span>

Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly valuable for improved performance across a variety of consumer products, from recommendations to automatic image classification.  However, despite aggregating large amounts of data, in theory it is possible for models to encode characteristics of individual entries from the training set.  For example, experiments in controlled settings have shown that language models trained using email datasets may sometimes encode sensitive information included in the training data and may have the potential to reveal the presence of a particular user’s data in the training set. As such, it is important to prevent the encoding of such charac…</span>

Now AWS users can quickly ingest logs stored in Amazon S3 with the new Elastic serverless forwarder, an AWS Lambda application, and view them in the Elastic Stack alongside other logs and metrics for centralized analytics. 
Skip lengthy processes like provisioning a VM or installing data shippers — and reduce management overhead by ingesting data directly from AWS to Elastic. 
In this blog, we will teach you how to use the Elastic serverless forwarder —  that is published in the AWS Serverless Application Repository (SAR …</span>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide more accurate results as the size and coverage of their training data increases. While investing in high-quality and large-scale labeled datasets is one path to model improvement, another is leveraging prior knowledge, concisely referred to as “rules” — reasoning heuristics, equations, associative logic, or constraints. Consider a common example from physics where a model is given the task of predicting the next state in a double pendulum system. While the model may learn to estimate the total energy of the system at a given point in time only from empirical data, it will frequently overestimate the energy unless also provided an equation th…</span>

ING Group is a Dutch-based multinational banking and financial services corporation serving more than 38 million customers globally. It’s one of the biggest banks in the world, and consistently ranks among the top 30 largest banks globally.
Our 20-year-old COBOL-based financial messaging system — which provides electronic instructions to enable financial transactions between banks and customers — is slowly becoming obsolete and difficult to integrate. COBOL is declining in popularity among developers, and many programmers with COBOL experience are retiring or will soon.
In addition, we’re seeing competition from fintech startups that are lowering the…</span>

Deep machine learning (ML) systems have achieved considerable success in medical image analysis in recent years. One major contributing factor is access to abundant labeled datasets, which are used to train highly effective supervised deep learning models. However, in the real-world, these models may encounter samples exhibiting rare conditions that are individually too infrequent for per-condition classification. Nevertheless, such conditions can be collectively common because they follow a long-tail distribution and when taken together can represent a significant portion of cases — e.g., in a recent deep learning dermatological study, hundreds of rare conditions composed around 20%…</span>

Elastic researchers enjoy finding new means for users to protect their organizations against attack. Recently, the Elastic Security team identified an unpatched Windows flaw in the Windows Protected Process Light (PPL) mechanism that lets malware disable security products, and incorporated a fix into Elastic Security to protect our users. 
In our full analysis, the team summarizes what Windows protected anti-malware services include, and how both sandboxing and access tokens can operate in a Windows environment. The author, Gabriel Landau, provides detailed insight into the way tokens can be leveraged by hackers to penetrate and evade Windows-based systems. The article also includes a recorded demonstration showing exactly how sandboxing can quietly incapacitate anti-malware products. 
Landau’s analysis also goes into depth about how anti-malware vendors can defend themselves  against this exposure with an obscure Windows feature called trusted labels. 
To find threats like malware and ransomware in your environment, install the latest version of Elastic Security, and be sure to take advantage of our quick start training to set yourself up for success. 
If you’re new to Elastic Cloud, you can always get started for free with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud or download the self-managed version of the Elastic Stack for free.
Happy hunting!</span>

Quantum processors are made of superconducting quantum bits (qubits) that — being quantum objects — are highly susceptible to even tiny amounts of environmental noise. This noise can cause errors in quantum computation that need to be addressed to continue advancing quantum computers. Our Sycamore processors are installed in specially designed cryostats, where they are sealed away from stray light and electromagnetic fields and are cooled down to very low temperatures to reduce thermal noise.  
However, the world is full of high-energy radiation. In fact, there’s a tiny background of high-energy gamma rays and muons that pass through everything around u…</span>

And we’re fast approaching the Lunar New Year, often also called the Chinese New Year, which will arrive next Tuesday. Reunion dinner will be on the 31st of January, and the two weeks of celebration will begin. All that to say that this is my last real chance, speaking I’m sure for the entire Tanzu team, to wish everyone around the planet (billions of people!) who celebrates a very happy Lunar New Year (Mandarin: 新年快乐 (pronounced: xin nian kauai le ) / Cantonese: 新年快乐 (pronounced: san nin fai lok )) and to say that we hope you enjoy prosperity in the new year (Mandarin: 恭喜发财 (pronounced: gong xi fa cai) / Cantonese: 恭喜发财 (pronounced: gong hei fat choy))!

Image matting is the process of extracting a precise alpha matte that separates foreground and background objects in an image. This technique has been traditionally used in the filmmaking and photography industry for image and video editing purposes, e.g., background replacement, synthetic bokeh and other visual effects. Image matting assumes that an image is a composite of foreground and background images, and hence, the intensity of each pixel is a linear combination of the foreground and the background.  
   
In the case of traditional image segmentation, the image is segmented in a binary manner, in which a pixel either belongs to the foreground or background. This type of segmentation, however, is unab…</span>

Birds are all around us, and just by listening, we can learn many things about our environment. Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and forest health — for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, that means there’s a lot of dead wood. Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear. In fact, experts may identify up to 10x as many birds by ear as by sight. 
In recent years, autonomous recording units (ARUs) have made it easy to capture thousands of hours of audio in forests that could be used to better understand ecosystems and identify critical habitat. However, manually reviewing the audio data is very time co…</span>

Language models are becoming more capable than ever before and are helpful in a variety of tasks — translating one language into another, summarizing a long document into a brief highlight, or answering information-seeking questions. Among these, open-domain dialog, where a model needs to be able to converse about any topic, is probably one of the most difficult, with a wide range of potential applications and open challenges. In addition to producing responses that humans judge as sensible, interesting, and specific to the context, dialog models should adhere to Responsible AI practices, and avoid making factual statements that are not supported by external …</span>

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring Boot 3.0.0-M1 has been released and is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

This milestone starts our exciting journey to the next generation of the Spring Framework and raises our baseline from Java 8 to Java 17. We are planning to release a new milestone of Spring Boot 3.0 every two months. M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.

If you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.

We’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.

Please see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.

If you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.

For a complete list of changes, please check the change log.

We also took the opportunity of this major version to remove deprecated APIs and fix some issues that require non backward compatible changes. The migration guide contains more details about these changes and provides the upgrade instructions.

As we continue our work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on this first milestone!

The M5 release is a quick follow-on after the feature-rich M4 release from December. The main goal for M5 was to move the Boot starter out of the Spring GraphQL repository and into Spring Boot proper, ahead of the first Spring Boot 2.7 milestone this Thursday. In addition to that, as always, there was plenty of feedback leading to a number of refinements and fixes.

Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another —  is often a mystery. Explaining a neural model’s decision process may have high social impact in certain areas, such as analysis of medical images and autonomous driving, where human oversight is critical. These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another jam-packed, fun-filled, rock’em sock’em installment of This Week in Spring! It’s the 18th of January and I’m feelin’ great because I just got back from a three-day weekend. Here in the US, we celebrated on Monday the life of the good Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights activist who advanced the plight of African American civil rights. Dr. King is another one of my favorite doctors, along with Drs. Syer, Strange, Who, Subramaniam, and Pollack.

How’re you? We’ve got a lot to cover so let’s get to it!

                    <span>Azure DevOps Server 2019 and 2020 use two different models for retaining builds. In Azure DevOps Server 2019, users configure retention settings for each pipeline. Organization-level defaults are applied if a pipeline is not explicitly configured for retention. Builds that are retained indefinitely or by releases are marked and handled using a common bit in the build record.

Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements in natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost incre…</span>

Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil…</span>

Over the last several decades, I&#x27;ve witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we&#x27;ll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I’ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we’ll likely see in the next few years.
