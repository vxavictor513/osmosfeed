                    <span>This quick blog is the first in a two-part series discussing a userland Windows exploit initially disclosed by James Forshaw and Alex Ionescu. The exploit enables attackers to perform highly privileged actions that typically require a kernel driver.

Protected process light
Windows 8.1 introduced the concept of Protected Process Light (PPL), which enables specially-signed programs to run in such a way that they are immune from tampering and termination, even by administrative users. The goal is to keep malware from running amok — tampering with critical system processes and terminating anti-malware applications. There is a hierarchy of PPL “levels,” with higher-privilege ones immune from tampering by lower-privilege ones, but not vice-versa. 

For more information on PPL processes, please …</span>

We asked Kiley Davidson, IT Systems Engineer, to talk about her experience and share how Elastic’s culture allowed her to come out at work and thrive as a trans woman.
 
How did you know that Elastic was a safe place for you when you joined in 2018?

                    <span>Dear Spring Community,



Today it’s my pleasure to announce releases of Spring Integration for Amazon Web Services extension versions 2.5.1 and Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0.



These releases can be downloaded from Maven Central:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-aws:2.5.1&#x27;




If you don’t use Kinesis Binder.
Or via Binder dependency:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis:2.2.0&#x27;




Spring Integration for AWS extension of 2.5.1 has some minor bug fixes after the previous 2.5.0 announcement.



The Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0 is the first release in the project generation which is based on a new independent Spring Cloud for AWS artifact. It also was upgraded to the latest Spring Cloud 2020.0.3 and has some other bug fixes and improvements.



Any feedback is welcome via all the available communication channels!

                    <span>Creating an entity-centric index that contains only the latest document for each entity can be useful in a number of situations. For example, maybe you&#x27;re managing an ecommerce site and you want to track the latest order placed by each of your customers. Or maybe you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven&#x27;t been active over a certain period. What&#x27;s the fastest and most efficient way to compile and organize such data?

Transforms in Elasticsearch enable you to create and maintain an entity-centric index based on the event index and a transforming function. Until recently, the only possible function was pivot, which is a continuous group-by plus aggregations. In version 7.12, we’ve added one more transforming function, called latest. It transforms a source index into a destinat…</span>

                    <span>In January 2021, we announced that starting with version 7.11, we would be changing the Apache 2.0 portions of Elasticsearch and Kibana source code to be dual licensed under Elastic License and SSPL, at the users’ discretion. As part of that change, we created Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2) as a permissive,  fair-code license, which allows free use, redistribution, modification, and derivative works, with only three simple limitations, outlined in our original announcement.  
  
 We&#x27;ve been happy to see the level of community support for this change.  While we would have preferred to collaborate with Amazon, we&#x27;re glad that with their fork and commitment to rename the Amazon Elasticsearch Service, it means that they will no longer be the cause of confusion in the Elasticsearch and Kibana commu…</span>

                    <span>Platforms like Ethereum have billions of dollars of market cap and large developer communities. However, it is still a challenge to build widely adopted DApps on it because of current limitations. Blockchain Proof of Work transactions are typically slow, and Proof of Stake transactions trade off decentralization to achieve high throughput. Transaction fees get expensive,

                    <span>If you have an application that connects to an RSocket server at runtime, how do you test it? We need a way for a test to start a server and tell us where it is listening, and then we need to be able to register request and response examples (a.k.a. &quot;contracts&quot;). That’s what this project provides - it’s like Wiremock but for RSocket.



Getting Started



The easiest way to use the project is as a JUnit (Jupiter) extension, e.g:




@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(RSocketServerExtension.class)
class SocketsApplicationTests {
	...
}




With this extension installed the Spring Boot tests will run with an RSocket server listening on a port given by test.rsocket.server.port, so the test can connect directly to it, or (more likely) the code that it is testing will connect to it. …</span>

The 29,000 Cerner employees in 30 countries are on a mission to shape the healthcare of tomorrow. They believe that their influence goes beyond healthcare, and impacts the world.

Jim Avazpour, Director of Infrastructure, says Cerner was challenged by the massive amount of data that they log — network storage, virtualization, and supporting services — to monitor the health of its infrastructure. In response, Cerner chose Elasticsearch as their logging solution to h…</span>

                    <span>In our last episode, I wrote about some speed improvements to date_histogram and I was beside myself with excitement to see if I could apply the same principles to other aggregations. I&#x27;ve spent most of the past few months playing a small part developing runtime fields but eventually I found time to take a look at the terms aggregation.
 
It&#x27;s time for terms!

With the date_histogram aggregation we got a huge performance boost by rewriting it as a filters aggregation internally. Rewriting terms as filters has more mixed results. I often saw a wonderful speed up (454ms -&gt; 131ms). Check the linked PR for more about &quot;often&quot;. But now that we&#x27;ve rewritten the agg as filters, we can do much better! 

We landed another optimization that I&#x27;m really excited about. It&#x27;s such a great shortcut it feel…</span>

                    <span>As a quality assurance engineer on the Kibana team at Elastic, Bhavya Raju Mandya makes an effort to see things from a different perspective. 

“My job is to break things,” says Bhavya. “I like impersonating a cat, being curious, seeing what happens if I knock something off, or moving something or changing the order to figure out what gives. The end goal is to protect and defend the quality of Kibana and that makes me happy.”

The value Bhavya places on curiosity and diverse perspectives is a direct result of her experiences. Bhavya grew up in the South of India, in a province called Karnataka. She studied software engineering and worked in Bangalore before moving to Montreal with her partner.

We recently did a talk about some of our Elasticsearch adventures at an Elastic meetup. You can find a recording here.

Before we look into our different use cases, it helps to get a high-level understanding of Adyen’s architecture.

At Adyen, we do many things, but the core of what we do is payment processing. Our payment platform is built for any business and every customer journey. We process payments across all sales channels.

                    <span>Greetings Spring community,



The Spring Web Services team has released 3.1.1. This is the first major release under the new versioning schema. Releases will no longer have .RELEASE and snapshots will only be -SNAPSHOT, to better comply with community approaches.



While we strive to maintain alignment with Spring Framework and Spring Security, we also test against Java 8, Java 11, and Java LATEST (JDK 16 as of today).



For more details, read the following release notes for each version:



Release Notes - Spring Web Services - Version 3.1.1.





#1198 - Test against JDK 16 on CI.



#1197 - Upgrade to Spring Framework 5.3.7.



#1187 - Upgrade to Spring Security 5.5.0.



#1199 - Don’t skip main build targets during releases.

                    <span>Camunda Platform Run, or Camunda Run for short, is a lightweight distribution of Camunda Platform that works straight out-of-the-box and comes pre-configured for production environments. Camunda Run is an excellent option if you’re just getting started with Camunda, or if you’re ready to use Camunda Platform in production. You can download the open-source Community Edition for free, and easily upgrade to the Enterprise Edition to access more features and support options. After you download and extract Camunda Run, you’ll find a configuration folder that contains a file called production.yml. The properties defined in this file are important for production environments and are derived from our guide to securing your Camunda Platform installation. To start Camunda Run with the production.yml configuration,...

                    <span>Red Hat Ansible Engine v2.9 introduced the first set of Resource Modules that make network automation easier and more consistent, especially in multi-vendor environments. These network resource specific and opinionated Ansible modules help us avoid creating overly complex Jinja2 templates to render and push network configurations, thereby easing the adoption of network automation both in green and brownfield environments. The resource modules, along with the tools provided in ansible.utils, are highly focused on allowing the end user to manipulate network configuration as “structured data” and not have to worry about network platform specific details.</span>

From our early days as a lightweight Java project, we’ve relentlessly innovated — engineering an end-to-end Process Automation tech stack that has helped organizations across the globe automate mission-critical processes. But innovation never stops and organizations continue to look for new ways to increase the velocity of business transformation. To address this need, more and more organizations are turning to the cloud, which is increasingly becoming a business transformation accelerator.  That being said, as enterprise applications are being built entirely in the cloud, organizations are struggling with automating processes across multiple systems, people, and devices in an end-to-end manner. These processes often include modern components...

We have continually developed additional resource modules to make automating network appliances easier, and more approachable, for novices and experts alike. These resource modules provide a consistent experience across multiple network vendors.
