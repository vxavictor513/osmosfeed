                    <span>Posted by Johan Ferret, Student Researcher, Google Research, Brain Team    
An approach commonly used to train agents for a range of applications from robotics to chip design is reinforcement learning (RL). While RL excels at discovering how to solve tasks from scratch, it can struggle in training an agent to understand the reversibility of its actions, which can be crucial to ensure that agents behave in a safe manner within their environment. For instance, robots are generally costly and require maintenance, so one wants to avoid taking actions that might lead to broken components. Estimating if an action is reversible or not (or better, how easily it can be reversed) requires a working knowledge of the physics of the environment in which the agent is operating. However, in the standard …</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How’re you doin’? I’ve been busy as all get out emceeing the Reactive Summit 2021 event (it’s free and it’s online!).

So, I’ll be doing tomorrow’s keynote with my friend and Google Developer Advocate James Ward. Join us! It’ll be super fun!

Emotions are a key aspect of social interactions, influencing the way people behave and shaping relationships. This is especially true with language — with only a few words, we&#x27;re able to express a wide variety of subtle and complex emotions. As such, it’s been a long-term goal among the research community to enable machines to understand context and emotion, which would, in turn, enable a variety of applications, including empathetic chatbots, models to detect harmful online behavior, and improved customer support interactions. 
In the past decade, the NLP research community has made available several datasets for language-based emotion classification. The majority of those are constructed manually and cover targete…</span>

                    <span>The Spring GraphQL team is pleased to announce a 3rd milestone towards a 1.0.0 release, driven with great help from the community .
Batch Mapping

The 2nd milestone introduced an annotation programming model for GraphQL data controllers with @SchemaMapping methods. The 3rd milestone adds a new @BatchMapping method.

If you’re familiar with GraphQL, you know that navigating an object graph can cause the “N+1 queries problem” if we’re not mapping carefully object relations. We could already leverage the Batching feature from GraphQL Java to solve that problem, but this release introduces dedicated support as well as an @BatchMapping annotation for a smoother experience:

Despite the success and widespread adoption of smartphones, using them to compose longer pieces of text is still quite cumbersome. As one writes, grammatical errors can often creep into the text (especially undesirable in formal situations), and correcting these errors can be time consuming on a small display with limited controls.

I’m doing well, as always. I literally just wrapped up presenting a fun session at the Russian Joker conference all about Spring and GraphQL. I got a ton of great questions from an enthusiastic audience. Thanks so much for joining me, everyone. I’ve got to get to other meetings, though, so let’s get this wonderful week in Spring out of the way!

                    <span>On behalf of the community, I am pleased to announce that Spring Cloud OpenFeign versions 2.2.10.RELEASE, 3.0.5 and 3.1.0-M4 have been released.

These are primarily security releases with fixes for the CVE-2021-22044. 

Applications using type-level @RequestMappingannotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to @RequestMapping-annotated interface methods. Although a response is not returned for a request sent in this way, it does reach the corresponding server-side endpoint.

The practice of using a type-level @RequestMapping on a Feign client interface has been discouraged in the documentation, but we’re now taking the step to reject it completely.

These versions will be picked up later by the 2020.0.x and 2021.0.x release trains, however, we recommend you already upgrade Spring Cloud OpenFeign in your projects to these most recent versions.

No additional issues were included for 3.0.5.</span>

With the release of Spring Cloud 2021.0.0-M3, we are taking a big step forward to addressing both of these concerns!

Spring Cloud Kubernetes has offered a DiscoveryClient implementation since its inception. However, the implementation required the application to have permissions to use the Kubernetes API server. This proved to be a major barrier for many Spring Cloud user’s, as Kubernetes administrators were hesitant to give apps permissions to make API requests to the Kubernetes API server.

Configuration management using Spring Cloud Kubernetes also suffered from the same requirement of needing acc…</span>

Stacey King Poling knows that tornadoes don’t really sneak up on you.
Growing up in Texas and living around the west, including in Oklahoma, Stacey knew what to look and listen for regarding the powerful storms: the National Weather Service warnings, the emergency sirens, the regular instructions on where to go and how to protect yourself. All that preparation and advanced warning helped Stacey and her family live through the 2013 El Reno tornado, the widest tornado ever recorded, and escape unscathed.
If only burnout had the same warning system.
With a 25-year career in engineering, Stacey, who is currently the Director of Engineering for Cloud Productivity at Elastic, has worked on her fair share of high-stress projects. She loves solving hard problems and always found herself energize…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Christopher Fifty, Research Engineer, Google Research, Brain Team 
Many machine learning (ML) models typically focus on learning one task at a time. For example, language models predict the probability of a next word given a context of past words, and object detection models identify the object(s) that are present in an image. However, there may be instances when learning from many related tasks at the same time would lead to better modeling performance. This is addressed in the domain of multi-task learning, a subfield of ML in which multiple objectives are trained within the same model at the same time.

Over the past 20 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about the scenarios they face. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using solutions their developers are familiar with and have been using for years. In addition, they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications that are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like AppDynamics, which automatically discovers and maps all applications, microservices, and infrastructure as …</span>

In this getting starting guide you will learn how elastic-package can help you quickly start a full Elastic Stack.
Elastic-package is an open source tool that will help you shorten your development time by providing pre-built commands. For example it will help you lint, format, test, build, and promote your packages.
Each and every developer that wants to contribute by creating their own integrations should use elastic-package. It will provide a ready-to-code environment.
Getting started with elastic-package
As a developer you can use elastic-package in two ways, the first one is through binary usage and the second one is by pulling elastic-package github repository.
For binary usage, start by downloading the latest version.
Pull the archive that you need and unarchive it locally.

Over the last several years, progress has been made on privacy-safe approaches for handling sensitive data, for example, while discovering insights into human mobility and through use of federated analytics such as RAPPOR. In 2019, we released an open source library to enable developers and organizations to use techniques that provide differential privacy, a strong and widely accepted mathematical notion of privacy. Differentially-private data analysis is a principled approach that enables organizations to learn and release insights from the bulk of their data while simultaneously providing a mathematical guarantee that those results do not allow any individual user&#x27;s data to be …</span>

At this year’s ElasticON Global, our annual user conference, we held multiple sessions focused on the financial services industry and how leading financial institutions are solving their data challenges with Elastic.
According to Boston Consulting Group, there is $300 million in potential revenue opportunity for every $100 billion in assets under management at banks through hyper personalization. Both banks and non-bank financial institutions are rallying around this opportunity by focusing on customer experiences and open banking initiatives and by building more interconnected microservices. This focus, while being good for customers, has introduced challenges such as acceleration of counterparty data sharing and ensuring the open banking ecosystem is secure.

New features in Elastic Cloud reduce data transfer and storage (DTS) costs, potentially resulting in lower or more predictable Elastic Cloud bills. Both features were introduced in 7.15.0 and are now enabled by default on Elastic Cloud.
While the capacity part of the Elastic Cloud bill can be pre-determined using a pricing calculator, data transfer and storage (DTS) consumption has been less predictable due to its fluctuating nature based on demand. With that in mind, we have developed new features that aim to reduce your DTS costs. By compressing data transfer inter-node indexing traffic and using snapshot storage for data relocation and recovery, we have reduced the amount of network traffic that traverses across the cluster.

Hundreds of millions of people use spreadsheets, and formulas in those spreadsheets allow users to perform sophisticated analyses and transformations on their data. Although formula languages are simpler than general-purpose programming languages, writing these formulas can still be tedious and error-prone, especially for end-users. We&#x27;ve previously developed tools to understand patterns in spreadsheet data to automatically fill missing values in a column, but they were not built to support the process of writing formulas. 
In &quot;SpreadsheetCoder: Formula Prediction from Semi-structured Context&quot;, published at ICML 2021, we describe a new model that learns to automatically generate formulas based on t…</span>

Machine learning (ML) models are being used more widely today than ever before and are becoming increasingly impactful. However, they often exhibit unexpected behavior when they are used in real-world domains. For example, computer vision models can exhibit surprising sensitivity to irrelevant features, while natural language processing models can depend unpredictably on demographic correlations not directly indicated by the text. Some reasons for these failures are well-known: for example, training ML models on poorly curated data, or training models to solve prediction problems that are structurally mismatched with the application domain. Yet, even when these known problems are handled, model behavior can …</span>

Vision-language modeling grounds language understanding in corresponding visual inputs, which can be useful for the development of important products and tools. For example, an image captioning model generates natural language descriptions based on its understanding of a given image. While there are various challenges to such cross-modal work, significant progress has been made in the past few years on vision-language modeling thanks to the adoption of effective vision-language pre-training (VLP). This approach aims to learn a single feature space from both visual and language inputs, rather than learning two separate feature spaces, one each for visual inputs and another for language inp…</span>

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in real-world applications, so understanding the uncertainty and robustness of a model is necessary to ensure performance in practice. For example, how do models behave when deployed on data that differs from the data on which they were trained? How do models signal when they are likely to make a mistake? 
To get a handle on an ML model&#x27;s behavior, its performance is often measured against a baseline for the task of interest. With each baseline, researchers must try to reproduce results only using descriptions from the corresponding papers , which results in serious challenges for replication. Having access to the code for experiments …</span>

Over the past 20 months, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on daily life, presented logistical challenges for businesses planning for supply and demand, and created difficulties for governments and organizations working to support communities with timely public health responses. While there have been well-studied epidemiology models that can help predict COVID-19 cases and deaths to help with these challenges, this pandemic has generated an unprecedented amount of real-time publicly-available data, which makes it possible to use more advanced machine learning techniques in order to improve results.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying deep learning to medical imaging tasks, with exciting progress in various applications like radiology, pathology and dermatology. Despite the interest, it remains challenging to develop medical imaging models, because high-quality labeled data is often scarce due to the time-consuming effort needed to annotate medical images. Given this, transfer learning is a popular paradigm for building medical imaging models. With this approach, a model is first pre-trained using supervised learning on a large labeled dataset (like ImageNet) and then the learned generic representation is fine-tuned on in-domain medical data.

A crystalline material has atoms systematically arranged in repeating units, with this structure and the elements it contains determining the material’s properties. For example, silicon’s crystal structure allows it to be widely used in the semiconductor industry, whereas graphite’s soft, layered structure makes for great pencils. One class of crystalline materials that are critical for a wide range of applications, ranging from battery technology to electrolysis of water (i.e., splitting H2O into its component hydrogen and oxygen), are crystalline metal oxides, which have repeating units of oxygen and metals. Researchers suspect that there is a significant number of crystalline metal oxides that could prove …</span>

For a machine learning model to generate meaningful text, it must have a large amount of knowledge about the world as well as the ability to abstract. While language models that are trained to do this are increasingly able to automatically acquire this knowledge as they scale, how to best unlock this knowledge and apply it to specific real-world tasks is not clear.  
One well-established technique for doing this is called fine-tuning, which is training a pretrained model such as BERT and T5 on a labeled dataset to adapt it to a downstream task. However, fine-tuning requires a large number of training examples, along with stored model weights for each downstream task, which is not always practical, parti…</span>
