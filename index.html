                    <span>Continuous integration is a coding practice where engineers deliver incremental and frequent code changes to create higher quality software and collaborate more. Teams attempting to continuously integrate new code need a consistent and automated pipeline for reviewing, testing, and deploying the changes. Otherwise change requests pile up in the queue and nothing gets integrated efficiently.

                    <span>Today, we are excited to announce the integration of New Relic One performance monitoring in Azure Spring Cloud.

Over the past 18 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about their scenarios. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using tools that their developers are familiar with and have been using for years, and they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications which are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like New Relic. With the integration of New Relic One in Azure Spring Cloud, you can continue your journey and easily instrument your S…</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management, and seems to have established itself as the de facto standard in this area these days. The shift from monolithic applications to microservices brought by Kubernetes has enabled faster deployment, where dynamic environments become commonplace. But on the other hand, this has made monitoring applications and their underpinning infrastructure more complex. Fortunately, Elastic has been widely used for infrastructure and application monitoring solutions for many years — both as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and more recently as Elastic Observability.

 David Ricordel, a consulting architect based in Barcelona, says: “If we bring more diverse people to our companies, it’s a way to allow people to feel safe being who they are.” Being safe, in turn, helps Elasticians focus their energy on work and growing as professionals.

                    <span>Even before COVID-19 forced nearly everyone to grapple with virtual work, most organizations had mountains of content scattered across numerous teams and dozens, if not hundreds, of apps. But now new research shows the cost of poor employee experiences for organizations: productivity, confidence, and opportunity.

While blended work environments are likely here to stay, 58% of 1,000 US-based knowledge workers surveyed by Wakefield Research on behalf of Elastic say searching for documents is a top work-from-home problem. Moreover, 81% say they have a hard time finding documents when a boss or client has put them in the hot seat. As employers forge new paths for growth in the post-pandemic era, and demand for a distributed work model persists, business leaders must better empower workers to …</span>

                    <span>Dear Spring community,



On behalf of the team and everyone who contributed, it is my pleasure to announce 2.0.0 version for Spring Integration Zip extension.



This version is fully based on recently released Spring Integration 5.5.1 has upgraded other dependencies and  all the tests have been migrated to JUnit 5. The previously released released version 1.0.4 of spring-integration-zip is not compatible with Spring Integration 5th generation.



Thank you everyone who contributed!



Cheers, 

Artem

Software performance issues come in all shapes and sizes. Therefore, performance tuning includes many aspects and subareas, and has to adopt a broad range of methodologies and techniques. Despite all this, time is one of the most critical measurements of software performance. 

In this multi-part series, I’ll focus on a few of the time-related aspects of software performance — particularly for security software. Each post in this series will focus on a single topic, including how to identify performance issues, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in future.

Companies like Google have used big data from its earliest days to steer their product suite in the direction consumers need. Other companies, like Apple, didn’t always use big data analytics to drive product design, but

                    <span>In a previous blog, we covered how you can incorporate synonyms into your Elasticsearch-powered application. Here, I build upon that blog and show how you can combine stemmers and multi-word synonyms to take the quality of your search results to the next level. 
 
Motivation

Imagine that you are using Elasticsearch to power a search application for finding books, and in this application you want to treat the following words as synonyms:

brainstorm
brainstorming
brainstormed
brain storm
brain storming
brain stormed
envisage
envisaging
envisaged
etc.
It is tedious and error prone to explicitly use synonyms to define all possible conjugations, declensions, and inflections of a word or of a compound word.

However, it is possible to reduce the size of the list of synonyms by making use of a …</span>

Administration is shifting to a host-based management and dedicated role pages for ECE proxies and control plane. Moreover, when you upgrade to ECE 2.10, you’ll see usability enhancements within the administration console, including:

Simplified management of ECE host roles, streamlining your operations
Easy access to a central view of all the physical or virtual hosts managed by ECE
A dedicated proxy and control plane view
This is an important first step in streamlining tasks and workflows within ECE to make it easier for ECE administrators like you to understand and operate. Keep reading to learn more.

This week was no exception. I joined the my buddy Matt Raible and Brian Demeers today for the OktaDev Twitch channel and we hacked on making the Spring Boot starter for Okta work with Spring Native. The goal is that you should be able to bring your application unchanged with Spring Native, and this is yet another example of that working. We didn’t know what issues we were going to face, but we managed to figure out the relatively minor things required to make it work within an hour and within two hours we had most a working, standalone “hints” .jar dependency that users can add to their spring-aot plugins dependencies. Hopefully they…</span>

Data onboarding often involves having to adjust ingestion architecture and implement configuration changes across data sources. We want to ensure that users trialing or migrating to Elastic can get data in quickly to start seeing the power of Elastic solutions as quickly as possible. That’s why we built an integration that automatically maps Splunk-ingested data to Elastic Common Schema (ECS).

                    <span>TL;DR: We recommend that you use the new point-in-time functionality in Elasticsearch if you can. The scroll API is no longer recommended for deep pagination (even though it still works).
Most data is constantly changing. When querying an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially searching for data at a given point of time. With an index that is constantly changing — as in most observability and security use cases — two identical queries performed at two different times will return different results because the data has changed over time. So, what do you do if you need to remove that time variable?
The point in time (PIT) reader, which was introduced in Elasticsearch 7.10, gives you the ability to repeatedly query an index as it was at a specific point in time.

How did Elastic give you opportunities to pursue your career goals?

Decisions that need to be made in an instant require answers in real time, but existing big data systems are unable to return queries quickly enough for real-time analytics. And with growing data being queried by more connected users than ever before, it’s getting increasingly challenging to maintain fast reaction times. 

The DoD Data Strategy approaches this challenge by providing a blueprint for how data should be managed and accessed by the services, ensuring that trusted information gets to the right destinations at the right time. In lock step, Elastic securely ingests and queries massive amounts of diverse datasets in near real time, across a distributed environment, to support all eight of the…</span>

I put together an episode of Spring Tips, the most comprehensive of its kind, introducing (almost) everything you’ll need to know about Spring Native and Spring Native 0.10.0 in particular. Start here. Spring Native is awesome and this is the comprehensive introduction I wish I’d had at the start. 

The next time we meet in this humble column, next week, will be June 22nd, and by then we’ll have passed summer solstice - the longest day in the year! - and the beginning of summer. Farewell (for now) to Spring, the season, and long live Spring, the easiest and most productive path to production for your applications. 

Anyway, my friends, we’ve got a ton of things to look at this week, starting of course with that Spring Native video and release announcement, of course, so let’s get to it! 


  
In this week’s installment of Spring Tips, I look at Spring Native 0.10.0, available now.

Driver developers can call APIs such as PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx to receive such events.

Despite the name, PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx callbacks are not actually invoked upon the creation of processes, but rather upon the creation of the first threads within those processes. This creates a gap between when a process is created and when security products are notified of its creation.

                    <span>It’s no secret that organisations are up against skilled, relentless and determined adversaries. Security operations teams need to continuously test their detection capabilities by carrying out adversary emulation plans that are made up of varying tactics, techniques and procedures  (TTPs) and track key metrics of their coverage in order to close any existing gaps.

There are many tools available for running adversary emulation plans and performing purple team exercises. This blog will focus on how teams can use Prelude Operator in conjunction with Elastic Security.

At Elastic, we’ve been working closely with the team at Prelude as we have a very similar mission — we want to help security teams of all skill levels, arming all analysts and red teams alike. We want to protect the world’s da…</span>
