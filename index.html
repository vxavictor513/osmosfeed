                    <span>Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) is an easy way to get the Elastic Stack up and running on top of Kubernetes. That’s because ECK automates the deployment, provisioning, management, and setup of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and more. 

As logging and metric data — or time series data — has a predictable lifespan, you can use hot, warm, and cold architecture to easily manage your data over time as it ages and becomes less relevant.

In this guide, we’ll explain how to set up SAML with auth0 as an identity provider (IdP) as well as how to configure your deployment for hot-warm-cold architecture with ECK. We’ll use production features such as:

Dedicated nodes
Zone awareness
Pod and node affinity
PodDisruption
Dedicated storage class
Before you get started, you should be familiar with SAML. …</span>

It’s one of those weeks where, even though the thing I wanted to happen - a vacation with the family - didn’t happen, what did happen - accidentally lots of free time with no meetings - has turned out wonderfully. It was all I could do to pry myself from the IDE to pull together this week’s roundup, but I am glad I did! There’s a ton of great stuff there. Let’s dive into it.

If you want a headline as to why you should consider adopting Elastic for security and observability, that is it. 

We often work with our customers to help them establish the business value of Elastic within their organizations. We commissioned Forrester to conduct a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of our security and observability solutions so our customers have an unbiased view that they can share with their internal stakeholders. The TEI examines the ROI organizations realize by deploying the Elastic Observability and Security solutions. 

This study showcases the incredible value that our customers are achieving and provides guidance to help you consider the costs, benefits, and business impact Elastic can bring to your organization.

As promised, we have now also released a fully trained detection model, anomaly detection configurations, and detection rules that you can use to get ProblemChild up and running in your environment in a matter of minutes. 

This blog provides a high-level breakdown of the steps to enrich your Windows process event data using the released model to generate alerts when LOtL activity is detected in your environment. A more detailed documentation of the steps to be followed can be found in our publicly available detection-rules repository.

Protected process light
Windows 8.1 introduced the concept of Protected Process Light (PPL), which enables specially-signed programs to run in such a way that they are immune from tampering and termination, even by administrative users. The goal is to keep malware from running amok — tampering with critical system processes and terminating anti-malware applications. There is a hierarchy of PPL “levels,” with higher-privilege ones immune from tampering by lower-privilege ones, but not vice-versa.

How did you know that Elastic was a safe place for you when you joined in 2018?

                    <span>Dear Spring Community,



Today it’s my pleasure to announce releases of Spring Integration for Amazon Web Services extension versions 2.5.1 and Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0.



These releases can be downloaded from Maven Central:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-aws:2.5.1&#x27;




If you don’t use Kinesis Binder.
Or via Binder dependency:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis:2.2.0&#x27;




Spring Integration for AWS extension of 2.5.1 has some minor bug fixes after the previous 2.5.0 announcement.



The Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0 is the first release in the project generation which is based on a new independent Spring Cloud for AWS artifact. It also was upgraded to the latest Spring Cloud 2020.0.3 and has some other bug fixes and improvements.



Any feedback is welcome via all the available communication channels!

                    <span>Creating an entity-centric index that contains only the latest document for each entity can be useful in a number of situations. For example, maybe you&#x27;re managing an ecommerce site and you want to track the latest order placed by each of your customers. Or maybe you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven&#x27;t been active over a certain period. What&#x27;s the fastest and most efficient way to compile and organize such data?

Transforms in Elasticsearch enable you to create and maintain an entity-centric index based on the event index and a transforming function. Until recently, the only possible function was pivot, which is a continuous group-by plus aggregations. In version 7.12, we’ve added one more transforming function, called latest. It transforms a source index into a destinat…</span>

                    <span>In January 2021, we announced that starting with version 7.11, we would be changing the Apache 2.0 portions of Elasticsearch and Kibana source code to be dual licensed under Elastic License and SSPL, at the users’ discretion. As part of that change, we created Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2) as a permissive,  fair-code license, which allows free use, redistribution, modification, and derivative works, with only three simple limitations, outlined in our original announcement.  
  
 We&#x27;ve been happy to see the level of community support for this change.  While we would have preferred to collaborate with Amazon, we&#x27;re glad that with their fork and commitment to rename the Amazon Elasticsearch Service, it means that they will no longer be the cause of confusion in the Elasticsearch and Kibana commu…</span>

                    <span>If you have an application that connects to an RSocket server at runtime, how do you test it? We need a way for a test to start a server and tell us where it is listening, and then we need to be able to register request and response examples (a.k.a. &quot;contracts&quot;). That’s what this project provides - it’s like Wiremock but for RSocket.



Getting Started



The easiest way to use the project is as a JUnit (Jupiter) extension, e.g:




@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(RSocketServerExtension.class)
class SocketsApplicationTests {
	...
}




With this extension installed the Spring Boot tests will run with an RSocket server listening on a port given by test.rsocket.server.port, so the test can connect directly to it, or (more likely) the code that it is testing will connect to it. …</span>

                    <span>Cerner Corp. is a supplier of healthcare information technology systems, services, and devices. The company, with $5.7 billion in annual revenue, empowers people and communities to engage in their own care. A key aspect of the business is surfacing data to enable their clients to make informed decisions about their healthcare. 

The 29,000 Cerner employees in 30 countries are on a mission to shape the healthcare of tomorrow. They believe that their influence goes beyond healthcare, and impacts the world.

Jim Avazpour, Director of Infrastructure, says Cerner was challenged by the massive amount of data that they log — network storage, virtualization, and supporting services — to monitor the health of its infrastructure. In response, Cerner chose Elasticsearch as their logging solution to h…</span>

                    <span>In our last episode, I wrote about some speed improvements to date_histogram and I was beside myself with excitement to see if I could apply the same principles to other aggregations. I&#x27;ve spent most of the past few months playing a small part developing runtime fields but eventually I found time to take a look at the terms aggregation.
 
It&#x27;s time for terms!

With the date_histogram aggregation we got a huge performance boost by rewriting it as a filters aggregation internally. Rewriting terms as filters has more mixed results. I often saw a wonderful speed up (454ms -&gt; 131ms). Check the linked PR for more about &quot;often&quot;. But now that we&#x27;ve rewritten the agg as filters, we can do much better! 

We landed another optimization that I&#x27;m really excited about. It&#x27;s such a great shortcut it feel…</span>

                    <span>As a quality assurance engineer on the Kibana team at Elastic, Bhavya Raju Mandya makes an effort to see things from a different perspective. 

“My job is to break things,” says Bhavya. “I like impersonating a cat, being curious, seeing what happens if I knock something off, or moving something or changing the order to figure out what gives. The end goal is to protect and defend the quality of Kibana and that makes me happy.”

The value Bhavya places on curiosity and diverse perspectives is a direct result of her experiences. Bhavya grew up in the South of India, in a province called Karnataka. She studied software engineering and worked in Bangalore before moving to Montreal with her partner.

We recently did a talk about some of our Elasticsearch adventures at an Elastic meetup. You can find a recording here.

Before we look into our different use cases, it helps to get a high-level understanding of Adyen’s architecture.

At Adyen, we do many things, but the core of what we do is payment processing. Our payment platform is built for any business and every customer journey. We process payments across all sales channels.

I’ve spent the last several days working with Spring Boot and Spring Native and I have to tell you, they’re epic.

It’s hard to know what the right comparison is. There’s not much you can do in this life that results in such an instantaneous, night-and-day difference in performance and memory profile with so few (user-visibile) changes. Imagine snapping your fingers and having your luxury hypercar (Spring Boot in this metaphor) transform into an equally c…</span>

                    <span>Greetings Spring community,



The Spring Web Services team has released 3.1.1. This is the first major release under the new versioning schema. Releases will no longer have .RELEASE and snapshots will only be -SNAPSHOT, to better comply with community approaches.



While we strive to maintain alignment with Spring Framework and Spring Security, we also test against Java 8, Java 11, and Java LATEST (JDK 16 as of today).



For more details, read the following release notes for each version:



Release Notes - Spring Web Services - Version 3.1.1.





#1198 - Test against JDK 16 on CI.



#1197 - Upgrade to Spring Framework 5.3.7.



#1187 - Upgrade to Spring Security 5.5.0.

The resource modules, along with the tools provided in ansible.utils, are highly focused on allowing the end user to manipulate network configuration as “structured data” and not have to worry about network platform specific details.</span>
