                              <span>Dear Spring Community,

I am happy to announce the 4.17.1 release of the Spring Tools 4 for Eclipse, Visual Studio Code, and Theia.
fixes and improvements


  
(Spring Boot) fixed: Eclipse STS 4.17 takes 96 % processor time on Intel i9 (#934)

  
(Spring Boot) fixed: BootLanguageServerBootApp class is taking all available cpu continuously (#932)

  
(Spring Boot) fixed: OpenRewrite unchecked, but always Language Server Background Job(Loading Rewrite Recipes) (#925)

  
(Spring Boot) fixed: [validation] spring.factories EnableAutoConfiguration key for boot 3.0 ignores ‘on’ setting (#917)

  
(VSCode) fixed: [vscode] Boot LS is broken if Java LS launch mode is ‘Hybrid’ (#919)


known issues


  
(Spring Boot): The newly introduced additional reconciling for Java source files which is used to show up additional validations and quick fixes can cause increased memory and CPU consumption. In case you stumble upon issues in this area, feel free to disable the reconciling via Preferences -&gt; Extensions -&gt; Spring Boot Tools -&gt; Open Rewrite (in VSCode) or Preferences -&gt; Language Servers -&gt; Spring Language Servers -&gt; Spring Boot Language Server -&gt; Open Rewrite (in Eclipse).

                              <span>Hi, Spring fans! Happy new year! It’s 2023 already! Who saw that comin’? I sure didn’t. This year promises to be more amazing than ever, and I can’t wait to be a part of it.

As usual, the first week of January is when we mark the date of the first installment of this humble roundup, This Week in Spring, waaaay back in the first week of January 2011! 12 years of This Week in Spring! Now that’s consistency! 

And it’s only possible because of you, dear community. Thank you. You, who have been consistently excellent every week of the year for years and years, are truly the reason for the season, and we appreciate you. This week is no exception! There’s a ton of great content, so let’s kick the year off right!


  
First, I’ll be speaking at the Atlanta JUG on the 16th of this month, by the by, so please join me, and we’ll dive headfirst into Spring in 2023!

  
Last week, I had the pleasure of interviewing my friend, and teammate, the legendary DaShaun Carter on a Bootiful Podcast

  
I love this post by Rafael Winterhalter (create of ByteBuddy and Bootiful Podcast guest on the amazing publish/subscribe capabilities of PostgreSQL. I love PostgreSQL. But then he goes even further, turning the mechanism into support in Spring Integration. He explains everything in this epic post, Using Postgres as a Message Queue

  
Create a new Git branch with no history - not strictly speaking Spring-related, but I thought it was interesting. Unless you’re not using Git… I suppose.

Ensure business continuity, protect your organization from cyber risk, and improve your customers’ and employees’ experiences all by putting your data to work in real-time. You already have the data — why not make it chip in for rent? A recent study found that 80% of companies surveyed saw an increase in revenue due to real-time data analytics. 
The reason you can solve these all-encompassing, complex business problems with data? It’s because so many of your business problems are really just data problems in disguise. Let’s dive into a few of those problems and how you can solve them.

2022 was an amazing year for Elastic with the introduction of dozens of new innovations across our Observability, Security, and Enterprise Search solutions, new customers, and deepening partnerships.
As we take a moment to reflect on the year in review, we’ve rounded up our top blog posts of 2022. We hope you enjoy them!
Elastic 8.0 
As we began the year, we also launched a new chapter with Elastic 8.0: A new era of speed, scale, relevance, and simplicity. Elastic 8.0 was the culmination of years of investment in the 7.x series to reduce memory usage and query overhead, and introduce new features to enhance relevance.
For example, we increased the speed of date histograms and search aggregations, enhanced the performance of page caching, and created a new “pre-filter” search phase. In ad…</span>

Kubernetes v1.26, released last month, introduced an alpha feature that
lets you specify a data source for a PersistentVolumeClaim, even where the source
data belong to a different namespace.
With the new feature enabled, you specify a namespace in the dataSourceRef field of
a new PersistentVolumeClaim. Once Kubernetes checks that access is OK, the new
PersistentVolume can populate its data from the storage source specified in that other
namespace.
Before Kubernetes v1.26, provided your cluster had the AnyVolumeDataSource feature enabled,

Kubernetes v1.26 includes significant advancements in network traffic engineering with the graduation of

                              <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! It’s 27 December as I write this and - being honest - I couldn’t be happier. It’s raining outside. I’m in a warm cozy office. Good music is playing. People are asleep in my home. I can hear the raindrops and wind outside the window. I’m at peace as I code. And code I have. I’ve been updating my blog, and a half dozen little side projects, to the new Spring Boot 3. This has given me a chance to do a little, shall we say, Spring cleaning, and also update my Github Actions to the latest and greatest. I’m pleasantly surprised by how many builds I’ve switched over to 3.0 and then used the AOT engine to build a GraalVM native image and it just worked!

We&#x27;re building this neat service in Python to ingest data in Elasticsearch from various sources (MySQL, Network Drive, AWS, etc.) for Enterprise Search.
Sucking data from a third-party service to Elasticsearch is usually an I/O-bound activity. Your code sits on opened sockets and passes data from one end to the other. That&#x27;s a great use case for an asynchronous application in Python, but it needs to be carefully crafted.
When data flows through that pipeline, we want to ensure we don&#x27;t blow the available resources (RAM/CPU/FDs). We also want to maximize the output without killing Elasticsearch or the backend service.
So it&#x27;s all about implementing the right throttling and backpressure safeguards and surfacing the right settings, so you can properly size how aggressive the service will be…</span>

The CPU Manager is a part of the kubelet, the Kubernetes node agent, which enables the user to allocate exclusive CPUs to containers.
Since Kubernetes v1.10, where it graduated to Beta, the CPU Manager proved itself reliable and
fulfilled its role of allocating exclusive CPUs to containers, so adoption has steadily grown making it a staple component of performance-critical
and low-latency setups. Over time, most changes were about bugfixes or internal refactoring, with the following noteworthy user-visible changes:
support explicit reservation of CPUs: it was already possible to request to reserve a given
number of CPUs for system resources, including the kubelet itself, which will not be used for exclusive CPU allocation. Now it is possible to also

Kubernetes 1.26 introduced a new Pod feature: scheduling gates. In Kubernetes, scheduling gates
are keys that tell the scheduler when a Pod is ready to be considered for scheduling.
What problem does it solve?
When a Pod is created, the scheduler will continuously attempt to find a node that fits it. This
infinite loop continues until the scheduler either finds a node for the Pod, or the Pod gets deleted.
Pods that remain unschedulable for long periods of time (e.g., ones that are blocked on some external event)
waste scheduling cycles. A scheduling cycle may take ≅20ms or more depending on the complexity of
the Pod&#x27;s scheduling constraints. Therefore, at scale, those wasted cycles significantly impact the
scheduler&#x27;s performance. See …</span>

                              <span>I am pleased to announce the availability of Spring Modulith 0.2. The release adds the following features:


  
We introduced @ApplicationModuleListener to ease the declaration of asynchronous, transactional event listeners that run in a transaction themselves. A model that we recommend as default to integration application modules. (#80, reference documentation)

  
The application module dependency structure is now also exposed as Spring Boot actuator. This allows operating infrastructure to visualize insights it provides to operations teams to be aligned with the application module structure (HTTP traces by module etc.) (#87, reference documentation

  
The Postgres event publication registry schema now follows Postgres best practices. (#81)


The release also contains the obligatory upgrade to Spring Boot 3.0.1. Find more information on the release page.</span>

Delegation of fsGroup to CSI drivers was first introduced as alpha in Kubernetes 1.22,
and graduated to beta in Kubernetes 1.25.
For Kubernetes 1.26, we are happy to announce that this feature has graduated to
General Availability (GA).
In this release, if you specify a fsGroup in the
security context,
for a (Linux) Pod, all processes in the pod&#x27;s containers are part of the additional group
that you specified.
In previous Kubernetes releases, the kubelet would always apply the
fsGroup ownership and permission changes to files in the volume according to the policy

Kubernetes v1.26 introduced generally available (GA) support for kubelet credential
provider plugins,
offering an extensible plugin framework to dynamically fetch credentials
for any container image registry.
Background
Kubernetes supports the ability to dynamically fetch credentials for a container registry service.
Prior to Kubernetes v1.20, this capability was compiled into the kubelet and only available for
Amazon Elastic Container Registry, Azure Container Registry, and Google Cloud Container Registry.

Analysis of Electronic Health Records (EHR) has a tremendous potential for enhancing patient care, quantitatively measuring performance of clinical practices, and facilitating clinical research. Statistical estimation and machine learning (ML) models trained on EHR data can be used to predict the probability of various diseases (such as diabetes), track patient wellness, and predict how patients respond to specific drugs. For such models, researchers and practitioners need access to EHR data. However, it can be challenging to leverage EHR data while ensuring data privacy and conforming to patient confidentiality regulations (such as HIPAA).

It’s the festive season. Regardless of whether you believe in Santa or celebrate Christmas or another holiday in December, we can all appreciate the speed at which good ol’ St. Nick flies around the world with his trusty reindeer delivering presents to all the good children.

He’s been doing this job for a long time. But in 2022, his sleigh got an upgrade thanks to Kibana dashboards! He is now able to track the cities he’s visited along the way, the state of his journey, and his cool Christmas playlist.

We’re a distributed, global company (and proud of it), but we do want to give Elasticisians a place to connect face-to-face should they choose. In fact, building community is one of our top priorities here at Elastic. That’s why we have offices in 15 cities around the world. While some Elasticians use them to work and connect, we also use them to host in-person events, like this summer’s Elasticamp. 

Currently, we have offices in: Amsterdam, Arlington, Austin, Bangalore, Berlin, Chicago, Copenhagen, London, Munich, New York, Paris, San Francisco, Singapore, Sydney, and Tokyo. 

What makes our offices special is that each one is designed with its location in mind. We want our employees to feel at home in their local office, so we hired local designers to create murals on the walls of eac…</span>

Differential privacy (DP) is an approach that enables data analytics and machine learning (ML) with a mathematical guarantee on the privacy of user data.  DP quantifies the “privacy cost” of an algorithm, i.e., the level of guarantee that the algorithm’s output distribution for a given dataset will not change significantly if a single user’s data is added to or removed from it. The algorithm is characterized by two parameters, ε and δ, where smaller values of both indicate “more private”. There is a natural tension between the privacy budget (ε, δ) and the utility of the algorithm: a smaller privacy budget requires the output to be more “noisy”, often leading to less utility. Thus, a fundamental goal of D…</span>

As more productive and healthy populations live longer, healthcare will be one of the most important aspects of society. The COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated adoption of modern technologies and shined a light on the importance of patient experiences. As more consumers are taking control of their data, healthcare systems are getting stretched. According to a study published by Deloitte and the Scottsdale Institute, 92% of healthcare technology leaders see digital capabilities as a path to achieve better patient experience.

In this blog post, we’ll explore how Elastic’s search capabilities can help address potential barriers to health equity, as outlined in the Center for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services (CMS) strategic pillars — specifically, how to deliver relevant results for healthcare i…</span>

Log files and system logs have been a treasure trove of information for administrators and developers for decades. But with more moving parts and ever more options on where to run modern cloud applications, keeping an eye on logs and troubleshooting problems have become increasingly difficult. 

While it’s often possible to ssh into a server and run commands like tail -f, this approach doesn’t scale for most developers and administrators. Even if you’re good on the command line, you might be able to find what you’re looking for in a log file using awk and grep and could even calculate some simple statistics around how often certain errors occur. But what if the applications are running across hundreds of servers or Kubernetes pods? Or even worse, what if the applications are split across…</span>

In Kubernetes 1.26, the 1st alpha release of validating admission policies is
available!
Validating admission policies use the Common Expression
Language (CEL) to offer a declarative,
in-process alternative to validating admission
webhooks.
CEL was first introduced to Kubernetes for the Validation rules for
CustomResourceDefinitions.
This enhancement expands the use of CEL in Kubernetes to support a far wider
range of admission use cases.
Admission webhooks can be burdensome to develop and operate. Webhook developers
must implement and maintain a webhook binary to handle admission requests. Also,
admission webhooks are complex to operate. Each webhook must be deployed,
monitored and have a well defined upgrade and rollback plan. To make matte…</span>

The structured nature of Kubernetes enables a repeatable and scalable means of deploying and managing services and applications. This has led to widespread adoption across market verticals for both on-premises and cloud deployment models. The autonomous nature of Kubernetes operation, however, demands comprehensive, fully-converged observability and security. This is uniquely possible today using the Elastic platform.
In this article, we discuss best practices for observing and securing application and service workflows on Kubernetes using Elasticsearch and OpenTelemetry. You will learn how to:

The Device Plugin framework was introduced in the Kubernetes v1.8 release as a vendor
independent framework to enable discovery, advertisement and allocation of external
devices without modifying core Kubernetes. The feature graduated to Beta in v1.10.
With the recent release of Kubernetes v1.26, Device Manager is now generally
available (GA).
Within the kubelet, the Device Manager facilitates communication with device plugins
using gRPC through Unix sockets. Device Manager and Device plugins both act as gRPC
servers and clients by serving and connecting to the exposed gRPC services respectively.
Device plugins serve a gRPC service that kubelet connects to for device discovery,
advertisement (as extended resources) and allocation. Device Manager connects to

Language models (LMs) are the driving force behind many recent breakthroughs in natural language processing. Models like T5, LaMDA, GPT-3, and PaLM have demonstrated impressive performance on various language tasks. While multiple factors can contribute to improving the performance of LMs, some recent studies suggest that scaling up the model’s size is crucial for revealing emergent capabilities. In other words, some instances can be solved by small models, while others seem to benefit from increased scale. 

Despite recent efforts that enabled the efficient training of LMs over large amounts of data, trained models can still be slow and costly for practical use. When generating text at inference time, most autoregressive LMs …</span>

Kubernetes v1.24 introduced an alpha quality implementation of improvements
for handling a non-graceful node shutdown.
In Kubernetes v1.26, this feature moves to beta. This feature allows stateful workloads to failover to a different node after the original node is shut down or in a non-recoverable state, such as the hardware failure or broken OS.
What is a node shutdown in Kubernetes?
In a Kubernetes cluster, it is possible for a node to shut down. This could happen either in a planned way or it could happen unexpectedly. You may plan for a security patch, or a kernel upgrade and need to reboot the node, or it may shut down due to preemption of VM instances. A node may also shut down due to a hardware failure or a software problem.

                              <span>Elasticsearch is a very versatile platform that supports a variety of use cases and provides great flexibility around data organisation and replication strategies. This flexibility can, however, sometimes make it hard to determine up-front how to best organize your data into indices and shards, especially if you are new to the Elastic Stack. While suboptimal choices will not necessarily cause problems when first starting out, they have the potential to cause performance problems as data volumes grow over time. The more data the cluster holds, the more difficult it also becomes to correct the problem, as reindexing of large amounts of data can sometimes be required.
When we come across users that are experiencing performance problems, it is not uncommon that this can be traced back to issue…</span>

This is our second year of inclusion in the Gartner Magic Quadrant for this category, and this year’s evaluation places Elastic as the furthest entry on the &quot;Completeness of Vision&quot; axis. We believe this placement, our market momentum, and the strength of our vision are outcomes driven by two fundamentals:

Our unwavering focus on search and the expanding toolkit of search capabilities we deliver to developers, search operators, and data analysts.
The Elastic platform’s ability to address a broad range of search application needs – from standalone applications like internal workplace search, to new search-powered applications built to deliver specific functionalities …</span>

                              <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring for Apache Pulsar 0.1.0 has been released and is now available from Maven Central.

This is the initial GA minor release of the framework. The full 1.0.0 GA release is expected mid Q12023 and will contain many more features. Although it still lives in the experimental Spring projects it is expected to move into the main Spring projects as part of the full release.
Notable Changes

We have been busy adding features since our last blog. Notable new features include:


  
Reactive support

  
GraalVM Native Image Support


Please see the release notes for more detail.

A great place to get started is the Quick Tour in the reference docs.
Stay in touch…

As always, we welcome feedback and contributions, so please reach out to us on GitHub.

In October 2020, we announced some permissions changes to our Artifactory instance to restrict anonymous access to the platform for third-party dependencies.

At that time, we asked the Community to source Spring releases from Maven Central. Today, we are announcing some changes to our infrastructure in alignment with that request so that we can better position repo.spring.io for the long term.

Organizations need real-world protection from malware, but how do you know what you’ll get for security coverage in advance of purchasing a product? AV-Comparatives offers a comparison as an independent organization performing systematic testing that checks whether security software lives up to its promises. They create a real-world environment for accurate testing.
The testing is well-regarded in the industry, assessing malware prevention, real-world protection, and performance of antivirus products. Elastic has performed well consistently on malware protection testing since 2017, starting with our legacy Endgame product and achieving Approved Business Security Product each test cycle. Now, we’re performing better than ever on the real-world protection test.

Ansible Lint is a command-line tool (part of the ansible-lint upstream community project) for linting of Ansible Playbooks, Roles, and Collections. Ok, so what exactly is “linting?” Its fundamental objective is to promote proven behaviors, patterns, and practices while avoiding typical traps that can quickly result in errors or make code more difficult to maintain. That is - leverage community recommendations and opinions in writing Ansible content by means of a tool to help ensure what you’re writing is generally valid.</span>

Dynamic resource allocation is a new API for requesting resources. It is a
generalization of the persistent volumes API for generic resources, making it possible to:
access the same resource instance in different pods and containers,
attach arbitrary constraints to a resource request to get the exact resource
you are looking for,
initialize a resource according to parameters provided by the user.
Third-party resource drivers are responsible for interpreting these parameters
as well as tracking and allocating resources as requests come in.
Dynamic resource allocation is an alpha feature and only enabled when the
DynamicResourceAllocation feature
gate and the
resource.k8s.io/v1alpha1 API group are enabled. For details, see the

In 2019 we launched Recorder, an audio recording app for Pixel phones that helps users create, manage, and edit audio recordings. It leverages recent developments in on-device machine learning to transcribe speech, recognize audio events, suggest tags for titles, and help users navigate transcripts. 
 
Nonetheless, some Recorder users found it difficult to navigate long recordings that have multiple speakers because it&#x27;s not clear who said what. During the Made By Google event this year, we announced the &quot;speaker labels&quot; feature for the Recorder app. This opt-in feature annotates a recording transcript with unique and anonymous labels for each speaker (e.g., &quot;Speaker 1&quot;, &quot;Speaker 2&quot;, etc.)…</span>

Major recent advances in multiple subfields of machine learning (ML) research, such as computer vision and natural language processing, have been enabled by a shared common approach that leverages large, diverse datasets and expressive models that can absorb all of the data effectively. Although there have been various attempts to apply this approach to robotics, robots have not yet leveraged highly-capable models as well as other subfields. 

Several factors contribute to this challenge. First, there’s the lack of large-scale and diverse robotic data, which limits a model’s ability to absorb a broad set of robotic experiences. Data collection is particularly expensive and challenging for robotics bec…</span>

The Kubernetes Special Interest Group (SIG) Release is proud to announce that we
are digitally signing all release artifacts, and that this aspect of Kubernetes
has now reached beta.
Signing artifacts provides end users a chance to verify the integrity of the
downloaded resource. It allows to mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks directly on
the client side and therefore ensures the trustfulness of the remote serving the
artifacts. The overall goal of out past work was to define the used tooling for
signing all Kubernetes related artifacts as well as providing a standard signing
process for related projects (for example for those in kubernetes-sigs).
We already signed all officially released container images (from Kubernetes v1.24 onwards).

When quantum computers were first proposed, they were hoped to be a way to better understand the quantum world. With a so-called “quantum simulator,” one could engineer a quantum computer to investigate how various quantum phenomena arise, including those that are intractable to simulate with a classical computer.  
    
But making a useful quantum simulator has been a challenge. Until now, quantum simulations with superconducting qubits have predominantly been used to verify pre-existing theoretical predictions and have rarely explored or discovered new phenomena. Only a few experiments with trapped ions or cold atoms have revealed new insights. Superconducting qubits, even though they are one of the main…</span>

Ad technology providers widely use machine learning (ML) models to predict and present users with the most relevant ads, and to measure the effectiveness of those ads. With increasing focus on online privacy, there’s an opportunity to identify ML algorithms that have better privacy-utility trade-offs. Differential privacy (DP) has emerged as a popular framework for developing ML algorithms responsibly with provable privacy guarantees. It has been extensively studied in the privacy literature, deployed in industrial applications and employed by the U.S. Census. Intuitively, the DP framework enables ML models to learn population-wide properties, while protecting user-level inf…</span>

Having these paths simplifies the development process, lets developers focus on their applications instead of infrastructure and speeds time to production. Microsoft and VMware have partnered to make Azure Spring Apps a golden path for deploying and scaling Spring applications in the cloud. And with new capabilities like the scale to zero and developer productivity enhancements, Azure Spring Apps now offers an even more economical and optimized route to get your Spring applications into production.

Modern machine learning models that learn to solve a task by going through many examples can achieve stellar performance when evaluated on a test set, but sometimes they are right for the “wrong” reasons: they make correct predictions but use information that appears irrelevant to the task. How can that be? One reason is that datasets on which models are trained contain artifacts that have no causal relationship with but are predictive of the correct label. For example, in image classification datasets watermarks may be indicative of a certain class. Or it can happen that all the pictures of dogs happen to be taken outside, against green grass, so a green background become…</span>

                              <span>Project signing is a new feature developed for Red Hat Ansible Automation Platform that came out in the latest 2.3 release. It enables users to sign project-based content (think playbooks, workflows, inventories, etc.) and verify whether or not that content has remained secure. It also features a new CLI tool, ansible-sign. This blog post will explain how it works, illustrate how to implement it, and highlight a few scenarios.</span>
