Now then, we’ve got a lot to cover and oh-so little time in which to do it. Let’s goo!

                    <span>While developing Elasticsearch, we occasionally come across an important problem with no simple or established approach to solving it. It&#x27;s natural to ask “hmm, is there an academic paper that addresses this?” Other times, academic work is a source of inspiration. We&#x27;ll encounter a paper proposing a new algorithm or data structure and think “this would be so useful!” Here are just a few examples of how Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene incorporate academic work:

HyperLogLog++ for cardinality aggregations
C3 algorithm for adaptive replica selection
Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) for nearest vector search in Lucene
MIC statistic to improve machine learning classification
Block-max WAND for faster top-hits retrieval in Lucene

Configuring CCS

Getting the Security app to work with CCS only requires a few minor changes. The first step is to configure the Security app so that it knows to look for the CCS index patterns instead of local index patterns. To do this open the Kibana ‘Advanced Settin…</span>

Now developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and security analysts can ingest data from Google Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack with just a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console. By leveraging Google Dataflow templates, Elastic makes it easy to stream events and logs from Google Cloud services like Google Cloud Audit, VPC Flow, or firewall into the Elastic Stack. This allows customers to simplify their data pipeline architecture, eliminate operational overhead, and reduce the time required for troubleshooting.

Many developers, SREs, and security analysts who use Google Cloud to develop applications and set up their infrastructure also use the Elastic Stack to troubleshoot, monitor, and …</span>

The 7.15 release of Elastic Cloud brings new integrations with Google Cloud that allow customers to ingest Google Cloud services data directly into their Elastic Cloud deployments and take advantage of additional network security with Google Cloud Private Service Connect. Plus, the Elastic Stack brings enhancements to Elasticsearch and Kibana including improved data transfer, better resiliency, and more flexible data ingest and analysis.

                    <span>Elastic Security 7.15 further arms the SOC to achieve extended detection and response (XDR). 
Malicious behavior protection applies behavior analytics to prevent attack techniques often leveraged by named threats by performing dynamic, stateful correlation of on-host events, and then reacting instantly to disrupt attacks before they cause damage.
Memory threat protection now safeguards Windows hosts, stopping attacks designed to evade most other defenses.
To accelerate response and prevent damage and loss, 7.15 adds host isolation for cloud-native Linux systems, making the capability now available on every OS protected by Elastic Agent.
