Language models are becoming more capable than ever before and are helpful in a variety of tasks — translating one language into another, summarizing a long document into a brief highlight, or answering information-seeking questions. Among these, open-domain dialog, where a model needs to be able to converse about any topic, is probably one of the most difficult, with a wide range of potential applications and open challenges. In addition to producing responses that humans judge as sensible, interesting, and specific to the context, dialog models should adhere to Responsible AI practices, and avoid making factual statements that are not supported by external …</span>

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring Boot 3.0.0-M1 has been released and is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

This milestone starts our exciting journey to the next generation of the Spring Framework and raises our baseline from Java 8 to Java 17. We are planning to release a new milestone of Spring Boot 3.0 every two months. M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.

If you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.

We’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.

Please see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.

If you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.

Elastic Security engineers have documented a less tedious way to find network beaconing from Cobalt Strike. In their full analysis ([1] [2]), Elastic Security team researchers Andrew Pease, Derek Ditch, and Daniel Stepanic walk users through the Elastic fleet policy, how to collect the beacon, beacon configuration, how to analyze its activity, and how you can set it up in your organization’s environment.
These two articles ([1] [2]) are ideal for helping security analysts identify, collect, and configure Cobalt Strike beacon payloads from an endpoint using Elastic. It is often difficult to collect the Cobalt Strike beacon payload from memory and extract its configuration to identify observables and cluster group activities, partially due to the tremendous amount of metadata the beacon’s configurations include.
The early stages of an intrusion usually include initial access, execution, persistence, and command-and-control (C2) beaconing. When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected, and it can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary. 
The information helps threat hunters and analysts monitor Cobalt Strike beaconing activity, but also provides useful indicators of compromise (IoCs) with which to start an investigation.
If you don’t have an Elastic Cloud cluster but would like to collect and configure the Cobalt Strike beacon, you can start a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud today.</span>

                    <span>One finds limits by pushing them. –Herbert A. Simon,,,
At Elastic, we focus on bringing value to users through fast results that operate at scale and are relevant — speed, scale, and relevance are in our DNA. In Elasticsearch 7.16, we focused on scale, pushing the limits of Elasticsearch to make search even faster, memory less demanding, and clusters more stable. Along the way, we uncovered a range of dimensions on sharding and in the process sped up Elasticsearch to new heights. 
Historically, we’ve recommended avoiding creating a gazillion shards in your cluster due to the resource overhead involved. However, with the new data streams indexing strategy in Fleet, more and more smaller shards will be generated from security and observability use cases, so it’s essential that we find new wa…</span>

Elasticsearch 7.16 introduced a new enrich policy: range. The range policy allows one to match a number, date, or IP address in incoming documents to a range of the same type in the enrich index. Being able to match against an IP range can be specifically useful in security use cases where the additional metadata can be used to further refine detection rules. As we’ve already added an example to our documentation using IP ranges, we’ll go through an example here using the date_range type.
Our fictional example: incidents and on-call schedules
Say we have a number of on-call schedules and we want to add them to Elasticsearch so that each continuous shift is a document. Let’s introduce our fictional test cases: Bob, Alice, Dan, Matt and Lizzie.

Elastic Security has verified a new destructive malware targeting Ukraine: Operation Bleeding Bear.
Over the weekend, Microsoft released details about this multi-stage and destructive malware campaign that the Ukrainian National Cyber Security Coordination Center has been referring to as Operation Bleeding Bear. 
Elastic users are fully protected from attacks like these through our advanced malware detection and Ransomware Protection capabilities, and the Elastic Security team continues to monitor these events. This case highlights the importance of prevention when it’s up against ransomware and malware with destructive capabilities.
In this full-length article, we break down the involved malware providing new insights and highlighting behaviors that can be used to help identify this activity.
Elastic Security researchers provide an overview of Operation Bleeding Bear, including how it wipes the Master Boot Record, uses tampering techniques such as disabling Windows Defender, leverages process hollowing, and corrupts files across the file system. We also outline defensive recommendations, specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and a how-to-locate and remediate guide using Elastic Security and the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework — identifying malware components at each stage. 
Existing Elastic Security users can access these capabilities within the product. If you’re new to Elastic Security, take a look at our Quick Start guides (bite-sized training videos to get you started quickly). And you can always get started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud.</span>

                    <span>,Elastic can now seamlessly ingest data from Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud so DevOps and SREs can monitor their Spring Boot applications to increase operational efficiency and developer productivity. ,
Azure Spring Cloud is a fully managed service for Spring applications that simplifies infrastructure management. A 2021 survey from Microsoft indicated that “end-to-end monitoring” is the second biggest challenge DevOps and IT managers face as they migrate Spring Boot applications to the cloud.
Now DevOps and SREs can monitor both Spring Boot logs and application metrics across all environments by automatically shipping them to Elastic. Teams can also correlate and add context to their observability data from Spring Boot applications with other observability data sets across their environment…</span>

It began with an earthquake swarm. More than 22,000 seismic events were recorded, at up to 3.5 on the Richter scale, beginning on September 11th, 2021. Just 8 days later, the first eruption on La Palma since 1971, and the largest in recorded history, commenced. For three months, lava ran out of the Cumbre Vieja volcano, pouring into the Atlantic Ocean surrounding the Canary Islands. 
The eruption destroyed more than 3,000 homes in a torrent of fire and liquid rock and caused untold impact on the islands’ fragile ecosystem and economy. Mercifully, only one death has been linked to this devastating event.
To track the path of destruction so that experts could raise awareness of the ongoing impact of the geothermal event, employees at Elastic used Elastic Maps’ time slider feature, which wa…</span>

Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another —  is often a mystery. Explaining a neural model’s decision process may have high social impact in certain areas, such as analysis of medical images and autonomous driving, where human oversight is critical. These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery.

It’s the 18th of January and I’m feelin’ great because I just got back from a three-day weekend. Here in the US, we celebrated on Monday the life of the good Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights activist who advanced the plight of African American civil rights. Dr. King is another one of my favorite doctors, along with Drs. Syer, Strange, Who, Subramaniam, and Pollack.

How’re you? We’ve got a lot to cover so let’s get to it!

Before Rick Laner joined Elastic as our new Chief Customer Success Officer, he wanted to confirm if the company was committed to scaling, focusing on the customer experience, and whether the culture is really as advertised. 
“Firstly, I really dug into the culture and tried to understand, ‘is it really how people operate? Are all the good things I heard true?’ After talking to more than 80 people in my first 8 weeks and observing how teams function, I realized it is absolutely the case,” said Rick. “People take pride in their innovation, uniqueness, making complex tasks simple, taking calculated risks, being humble and respectful. It is truly the way people operate, and the leadership do the same and reward it.  It is all true.”

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I am pleased to announce that Spring REST Docs 3.0.0-M1 is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

This initial 3.0 milestone contains 13 enhancements, documentation improvements, and dependency upgrades. It covers the baseline upgrade efforts, in particular requiring JDK 17 and Spring Framework 6 and migrating to the Jakarta EE 9 APIs as announced in this blog post.

Please note that support for REST Assured has been removed temporarily as it is not yet compatible with Jakarta EE 9. We hope to reinstate support in a subsequent milestone prior to 3.0’s release towards the end of this year.

Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements in natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost incre…</span>

2021.x vs. 2022.x

You might now ask why is there a new release in the calver 2021.x version and why is there already a 2022.x release?

In parallel to working on Spring Data 3.x, aka 2022.0.0, we continue to invest in the support of the Spring Data 2.x development line. We already expect Spring Data 2.7 and 2.8 releases. So, if you want to continue using Spring Boot 2 for an extended period of time, stick to the 2021.x release trains (which are based on Spring Framework 5.3 and Java 8). That’s the reason we chose to continue with calver 2021.x, which, hopefully, makes understanding version compatibilities easie…</span>

While nearly one in five companies say they are releasing code 10 times faster than in the past, more software means more security flaws, and greater opportunity for bad actors to take advantage of them. 
The faster pace and increasing risks highlight the need for IT leaders to get serious about embracing DevSecOps, a management approach that makes security a shared responsibility among development, security, and IT operations teams. One indication that DevSecOps is gaining traction in the enterprise: Nearly half of development teams used application security tools in 2020, compared to just under 30% in 2015, according to 451 Research, part of S&amp;P Global Market Intelligence.

The rise of “Open Banking” has enabled banking customers to choose to share their previously inaccessible, locked down data with all sorts of third parties — from budgeting apps to mobile wallets, to peer to peer payment providers. This revolution has been a welcome boon for banks, customers, and financial services innovators alike. The ability to securely share access and permissions to accounts has fueled the rise and growth of an entire new industry — FinTech —  as retail and institutional customers finally have the power of choice. The result has been the creation of an ever-growing ecosystem of new players constructing applications, modernizing infrastructure, and accelerating the pace of change.

Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil…</span>

Overview
Following the discovery of Log4Shell, a vulnerability in Log4J2, Elastic released a blog post describing how users of our platform can leverage Elastic Security to help defend their networks. We also released an advisory detailing how Elastic products and users are impacted.
In this blog, we expand on these initial posts and highlight how the combination of security and observability solutions can provide deep visibility into the exploited vulnerability and arm security analysts with valuable data for root cause analysis.
Gaining the upper hand - combining Observability and Security data
Along with Elastic Security, we provide a comprehensive Observability suite within Kibana. Observability is primarily referring to the combination of application performance monitoring (APM), lo…</span>

Over the last several decades, I&#x27;ve witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we&#x27;ll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I’ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we’ll likely see in the next few years.

                    <span>Happy New Year, Spring community!



Hope you had great holidays and ready for new excitements in front of us.



After the rest and recharging during Christmas break I decided to pay honor to my favorite language back in days - Groovy.



And now it’s my pleasure to present you a brand new Groovy DSL for Spring Integration.
You perhaps heard about our old attempt to make a Groovy DSL on top of Spring Integration XML support.
But the solution was pretty cumbersome (especially for protocol-specific channel adapters) and support burden has grown tremendously.
This my latest implementation is fully based on already mature Java DSL and its builder pattern support.



Having 10 years experience with Gradle I thought that it is going be easy enough for me to prepare quickly someth…</span>
