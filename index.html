                    <span>As announced at SpringOne yesterday, Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 are planned towards a high-end baseline for their general availability in Q4 2022:


  
Java 17+ (from Java 8-17 in the Spring Framework 5.3.x line)

  
Jakarta EE 9+ (from Java EE 7-8 in the Spring Framework 5.3.x line)


This forward-looking baseline will provide significant benefits in our API design and integration efforts, shining through to your application code and future-proofing the framework as well as your applications for many years to come. However, it comes at a cost, of course: Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 based applications will require a minimum of JDK 17 at runtime, as well as a minimum of Tomcat 10 / Jetty 11 (for Jakarta EE 9 compatibility).

Not only must these technologies be in lock step with the 8 guiding principles of the DoD Data Strategy, but they must also deliver on the Army’s data imperatives of speed, scale and resilience.

Over the past 18 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about the scenarios they face. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using solutions their developers are familiar with and have been using for years. In addition, they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications that are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like Dynatrace OneAgent, which automatically discovers and maps all applications, microservices, and infrastruct…</span>

I’m happy to announce that the 1.0.0-M2 version has been released and is available from the Spring Milestone repository.

The Spring GraphQL team would like to thank the early adopters and contributors - with your help, we’re making good progress towards a GA version!

We’ve fixed a few issues and renamed a couple of concepts, but the most notable change is the introduction of a new annotation model for GraphQL Controllers.
You can now annotate @Controller components to handle queries, mutations and subscriptions:

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

        @QueryMapping 
        public String hello() { 
            return &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
        }

}


This is a new feature and we can’t wait to hear your feedback - please give it a try and let us know what you think!
Spring GraphQL at SpringOne!

Don’t miss the Spring GraphQL presentation at SpringOne today!
This will give a nice intro to this new Spring project and you’ll get a chance to chat with the team, live and on the dedicated SpringOne Slack.
How can you help?

If you’re interested in helping out, you can get started with Spring GraphQL and raise issues on our GitHub project.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans, and welcome to another riveting roundup of all the news that’s fit to reprint in the Java and Spring ecosystems, with apologies, as always, to The Times. We’re a week away from SpringOne 2021, our annual, free, and utterly online tentpole conference featuring hundreds of hours of amazing technical content from speakers all around the world and tens of thousands of attendees with whom to partake in the festivities. Do not miss this! I’ll be there! 

I get so excited in the leadup to SpringOne each year, and this year doubly so! First, there’s the usual monumental scope of the whole thing, which always gets me. I also just got my first (of hopefully many) negative COVID-19 tests a few days ago, after three weeks of convalescence. Huzzah! I’m still taking it easy, trying to …</span>

                    <span>or: How To Build a Mental Framework for Spring Framework

EDIT: There’s a great comment below that mentions that the original title, Structuring Spring Boot Applications, is a bit misleading, in that the blog doesn’t intend to talk about how to organize types and packages, and instead thinks about how Spring interacts with the objects in your code. The next paragraph sought to clarify that point but apparently fell short. Anyway, I’ve changed it, which unfortunately will break earlier links to it. I’m sorry for both the poor title and the now two days of broken links. I hope it’s useful for everyone, even if I clearly could’ve done a better job with the title…

                    <span>Since its inception, Elastic Security has had a clear mission: to protect the world&#x27;s data and systems from attack.

We started with SIEM, built on top of the Elastic Stack, applying its fast and scalable search capabilities to detect security vulnerabilities across all threat vectors. Next, we joined forces with Endgame to integrate endpoint security into Elastic Security, and allow customers to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks from a single, unified platform. With the recent release of Elastic Security Limitless XDR and the general availability of Elastic Agent, we furthered our mission.

Today, we are excited to announce the next step in the Elastic Security journey: to extend security enforcement from every endpoint to every cloud workload.

                    <span>Kibana creates easy ways to do powerful things with all of your data — to ask and answer questions and follow the flow of analysis. Many times the answer to your question requires calculations based on queried data. Formulas allow you to author your own metrics by combining multiple aggregated fields using math operations.

In addition, moving through and replaying your data in time and space are powerful ways to gain historical context and understand additional insight about the present.

In the below sections you’ll find 10 examples of questions you can answer with dashboard data and map visualizations in Kibana via formulas, time shifts, and moving through data in time.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doing? I’m alright. I’ve been recuperating from a COVID-19 infection. Today was the first day in a while that I woke up and wasn’t short of breath. Most days, I’ve woken up, hacked a few wads of phlegm into the toilet, and then my breathing was fine. But today I woke up and wasn’t short of breath in the first place. (I still hacked a few wads of phlegm). Thank goodness for vaccines, or I expect my experience of this virus would’ve been much worse as a lifelong asthmatic. Things are looking up! 

And then, as if my fortunes couldn’t get any better, I got to compiling this week’s roundup and there’s a ton of great stuff in it so let’s dive right in!

                    <span>We are very excited to announce that Spring Authorization Server has officially moved out of experimental status and into the Spring project’s portfolio!



This move coincides with this week’s 0.2.0 release, which is the first officially supported production-ready version backed by our new support policy.



Since announcing the Spring Authorization Server in April 2020, the implemented features provide support for a large portion of the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework and modest support for OpenID Connect 1.0. However, as we move onto the next phase of development, our focus changes to advancing the support for OpenID Connect 1.0.



On behalf of the team, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed and helped grow this project in this short time frame. We are confident in the base that we have built so far and are excited for the next phase of the project. We look forward to continuing this work together and ultimately making Spring Authorization Server the de facto framework for OAuth 2 Authorization Server support on the Java platform.



Let’s get moving onto the next phase!</span>

An application running in production is a difficult beast to tame.

Most experienced developers–ones who spent enough late nights or Saturday mornings trying to break apart a nasty production bug–will try and create the clearest possible picture for their later selves while writing their code, so that they could understand what’s actually going on in the system during an incident.

CTI is contextual information obtained through research and analysis of emerging threats and the application of defensive countermeasures to enhance the protective posture of contested environments. It helps organizations to better understand past, current, and future threats.

                    <span>With Elastic 7.14, the filestream input, the successor of log input, is now generally available in Filebeat. This new, superior input provides better support for reading active log files, with faster reaction time when there is backpressure in the system, quicker registry updates, better cooperation with external log rotation tools, and more. 
 
Improved registry performance
 
Previously, when a registry file (the file used for saving the progress of publishing events) contained many entries, state updates became slower, even if Filebeat was only collecting a few files. The main problem was that the complete registry was serialized after every ACK from the outputs. That required an expensive fsync call per registry write. Now offset updates are written to the file in an append-only manner.…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doing? I hope you’re doing well. You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about how to retain that zen-like peace that comes with a vacation spent on the beach. I got back from Hawaii eight days ago and I found it to be so very beautiful. Nature really sold it for me; the fresh air is everything. If you don’t have ready access to nature - if you, like me, are in a giant city with the ongoing sound of car horns (“klaxons”), fire engines, traffic, and everything else that accompanies any big city - then may I invite you to breathe with me? 

Just sit still for 30 seconds. Focus on these words. Inhale. Take a big, deep breath, and then hold it in for a few seconds. Then exhale. When was the last time you did that? I don’t do that nearly enough. If I spend 30 or 60 secon…</span>

Before we continue with this exciting news, we want to remind you that this is an alpha version. We recommend that you keep it an arm&#x27;s length from production. There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-alpha1 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).

Also, 8.0.0-alpha1 will not be available on Elastic Cloud. But, we expect to make a preview version available in the coming months.

We are also excited to bring back the Elastic Pioneer Program for 8.0. The Pioneer Program debuted in version 5.0 to recognize community participation and feedback. It has been a source of invaluable feedback during the preview …</span>

But the survey also revealed that the biggest benefits of a distributed environment could be the new opportunities it opens for employees — for example, the freedom to catch some waves during the workday.

As Elastic offices slowly begin to reopen worldwide in accordance with local guidelines, we asked our Engineering and Product teams why they value being able to work for a company that’s distributed by intention — whether they work in an office, a shared workspace, or from home.
