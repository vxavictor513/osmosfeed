CTI is contextual information obtained through research and analysis of emerging threats and the application of defensive countermeasures to enhance the protective posture of contested environments. It helps organizations to better understand past, current, and future threats.

                    <span>With Elastic 7.14, the filestream input, the successor of log input, is now generally available in Filebeat. This new, superior input provides better support for reading active log files, with faster reaction time when there is backpressure in the system, quicker registry updates, better cooperation with external log rotation tools, and more. 
 
Improved registry performance
 
Previously, when a registry file (the file used for saving the progress of publishing events) contained many entries, state updates became slower, even if Filebeat was only collecting a few files. The main problem was that the complete registry was serialized after every ACK from the outputs. That required an expensive fsync call per registry write. Now offset updates are written to the file in an append-only manner.…</span>

You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about how to retain that zen-like peace that comes with a vacation spent on the beach. I got back from Hawaii eight days ago and I found it to be so very beautiful. Nature really sold it for me; the fresh air is everything. If you don’t have ready access to nature - if you, like me, are in a giant city with the ongoing sound of car horns (“klaxons”), fire engines, traffic, and everything else that accompanies any big city - then may I invite you to breathe with me? 

Just sit still for 30 seconds. Focus on these words. Inhale. Take a big, deep breath, and then hold it in for a few seconds. Then exhale. When was the last time you did that? I don’t do that nearly enough. If I spend 30 or 60 secon…</span>

                    <span>While the 7.x minors keep delivering feature after feature, we are thrilled to announce the first public alpha of 8.0.0.

Before we continue with this exciting news, we want to remind you that this is an alpha version. We recommend that you keep it an arm&#x27;s length from production. There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-alpha1 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).

Also, 8.0.0-alpha1 will not be available on Elastic Cloud. But, we expect to make a preview version available in the coming months.

                    <span>Blockchain protocols like Bitcoin and Ethereum have changed the cyber world dramatically in the last decade. They’ve created communities of like-minded developers, generated new financial markets, and popularized “decentralization” in computer networks. However, they require large resources to operate which makes scaling difficult and transactions expensive. Hedera is a decentralized public network that takes the

And I am, for better or for worse, back from vacation! I am so happy to be back, but I do miss the sunkissed beaches of Hawai’i. Sigh. Anyway, let’s get into it!

Let’s dig into the best of what it brings.
Quickly quarantine and inspect endpoints
Elastic Security 7.14 accelerates response by enabling analysts to invoke response actions with Elastic Agent. With the first native response action for Elastic Agent, host isolation, analysts can address malicious activity by quarantining a host from a network, containing the attack and preventing lateral movement to other hosts.

Security vendors are using the term “XDR” with increasing frequency, applying varied definitions to suit their respective technologies. The term began as an evolution of EDR (endpoint detection and response), and tried to encapsulate the need for varied data sources in the investigative process by using “X” for “eXtended.” Through all the varying definitions, the core concepts remain:

Elasticsearch is attractive for log analysis thanks to its ability to index log messages. Want to count how many log messages contain access denied in the last 24 hours? Elasticsearch can give you the answer in milliseconds thanks to its index structures — but index structures take CPU time to build and need disk space. You could save this CPU and disk space by not indexing your message fields, but then you would also lose the ability to query your logging data in an interactive way.

In order to reduce disk space requirements, match_only_text only indexes a subset of the information…</span>

First, we are launching the generally available (GA) release of our Elastic Agent, which is a single, unified agent for both observability and security. A unified agent will simplify data onboarding with fewer things to configure and install.

Second, we are launching the GA release of Fleet, a new Kibana app that lets you centrally manage an entire fleet of Elastic Agents at scale. It acts as a control plane, giving you a real-time view into agent status, remotely upgrade agents, execute queries on each host, and contain security threats.

                    <span>As we’ve shown in a previous blog, search-based detection rules and Elastic’s machine learning-based anomaly detection can be a powerful way to identify rare and unusual activity in cloud API logs. Now, as of Elastic Security 7.13, we’ve introduced a new set of unsupervised machine learning jobs for network data, and accompanying alert rules, several of which look for geographic anomalies. In this blog post, we’ll explore a case study demonstrating how network data can yield important detections. 

Before the advent of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security teams relied heavily on network instrumentation like firewall logs and intrusion detection (IDS) alerts. Given the lack of process information or user context, in network logs, the false positive rate for network events c…</span>

                    <span>Hiya! Our Elasticsearch team is continually improving our index Lifecycle Management (ILM) feature. When I first joined Elastic Support, I quickly got up to speed via our Automate rollover with ILM tutorial. I noticed after helping multiple users set up ILM that escalations mainly emerge from a handful of configuration issues. 

In the following sections, I’d like to cover frequent tickets, diagnostic flow, and common error recoveries. All commands shown can be run via Kibana’s Dev Tools.
 
Configure

The ILM backend process runs by default but requires user configuration to affect indices. You can verify ILM is running via ILM status returning operation_mode:RUNNING.

Common issue 1: ILM is not running

                    <span>One of Rain Hu&#x27;s favorite moments of the day is her early morning run. &quot;I run six kilometers minimum daily, rain or shine,&quot; she says. &quot;I enjoy the time alone because it allows me to have time for self-reflection and self-conversation.&quot;

The discipline that it takes to maintain a healthy lifestyle is carried throughout her life. As a wife, mother of two young boys, and sales leader, Rain optimizes her time so that she can show up fully and authentically in all aspects of her life.

We sat down with Rain, Regional Vice President of Sales (ASEAN and Hong Kong) at Elastic, to learn how she has built a career she loves. Read on to learn about how she grew her career in tech sales and what advice she has for others looking to do the same.

                    <span>In my previous blog post, I demonstrated how to use Prometheus and Fluentd with the Elastic Stack to monitor Kubernetes. That’s a good option if you’re already using those open source-based monitoring tools in your organization. But, if you’re new to Kubernetes monitoring, or want to take full advantage of Elastic Observability, there is an easier and more comprehensive way. In this blog, we will explore how to monitor Kubernetes the Elastic way: using Filebeat and Metricbeat.
Using Filebeat and Metricbeat
Beats, as you know, is a free and open platform dedicated to data shipping. Using Beats, you can transfer data from hundreds or thousands of machines to Logstash or Elasticsearch.
Filebeat, which is known as a lightweight log shipper, also supports containerized architecture. Filebeat ca…</span>
