                    <span>On behalf of the team, I’m pleased to announce the availability of the Spring Data 2021.1.0-M1 milestone release.

Both releases are built on top of Spring Framework 5.3.9. For your convenience, you can consume this release through Spring Boot 2.6.0-M1, which our team mates on the Boot team will release in about a week.

The 2021.1 release train ships a set of features and dependency upgrades.
The most important changes are:


  
Upgrade to Querydsl 5.

  
Support for a wide range of Redis 6.2 commands.

  
Support for dialect-dependent custom conversions in Spring Data JDBC. This was used to improve the support of java.time types across multiple databases.

  
Support for streaming large result sets in Spring Data JDBC.

  
Support for AggregateReference in query derivation.

                    <span>DevOps has shortened the development life cycle for countless applications and is embraced by companies around the world. But managing and monitoring multiple environments is still a major pain point, particularly when companies need to mix cloud and legacy systems. Knowing when services go down and quickly pinpointing the cause is essential for continuous development.

                    <span>TL;DR - head over to spring.io/survey to take the State of Spring 2021 survey! You can also RT this tweet and help spread the word! Thank you &lt;3


We ran the State of Spring survey last year, and it was a huge success. Spring community members across the globe, like you, shared their views and experiences, and it all made for fantastic reading.

The survey is back this year, and we want to hear from you! How can Spring help you build new apps and experiences this year? What would you like us to change? This year, we have new sections on Spring Native, building &amp; sharing APIs internally/externally, and a deeper dive on Data.

In exchange for 15 minutes of your time taking the survey, you’ll be among the first to receive our report and the insights included in it. 

Sounds good? Head over to spring.io/survey now! The survey will close at the end of July. 

Do consider helping us share the survey by retweeting this post on Spring Central twitter, and thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us!

                    <span>Is enterprise data a benefit or a burden?

Think about all of the data your organization generates and consumes in the digital age — from security event logs to application error messages, energy consumption to vendor contracts. There is so much, and all of it is usually stored in silos, making the data difficult to synthesize to provide better services, identify signals proactively, or make stronger business decisions. How do organizations overcome the challenges of understanding their data so that they can finally derive value from it, allowing organizations to truly put their data to work? 

The answer is to shift your organization’s thinking away from the complexity of consolidating data to how to better find the answers within it. More data can mean more insights, and those benefits h…</span>

In this episode, we’ll discuss another time-related performance aspect that is unique to security software: application startup time. You don’t need to be a developer to benefit from this article. As long as you are curious to find out how the applications in your environment perform and why sometimes they seem to be very slow and want to improve that, you might find this blog post helpful.

Notable Changes in the Hoxton Release Train

See all issues included in this release here.

This was primarily a bug fix and documentation release. Hoxton.SR12 is compatible with Spring Boot 2.3.x and 2.2.x.

                    <span>Users of Elastic Security are protected through numerous layers of protections against the REvil ransomware that affected Kaseya VSA and its customers. Elastic Security’s layered protections prevented 100% of the REvil ransomware samples tested before damage and loss could occur to the business.

We believe that detections and preventions must be layered, as no single protection works 100% of the time. There are times where detection in the SIEM/central analytics layer is the most effective, especially when you need to take signals from multiple places or correlate the activity to determine it is malicious. However, the most effective way to stop an attack is at the host. 

Prevention is paramount when it comes to ransomware. Teams cannot wait to be notified of an issue after their data is…</span>

With the goal of being “secure by default,” we are deprecating ciphers that are considered weak and insecure. Going forward, we will only support ciphers that are included in the Mozilla intermediate list. These changes will take effect after January 30, 2022. We will communicate a precise date closer to the change.

What are the changes?
We are updating the list of ciphers supported for clients connecting to their Elasticsearch clusters, Kibana, or other components on Elasticsearch Service. The changes are basically on two fronts:

Introduction

If you’re looking to get started, please head over to our reference documentation and read the “Boot Starter” section, or run the samples.

If you don’t know much about GraphQL, there are plenty of good resources. You can start at graphql.org/learn. 

GraphQL is widely adopted and in “Early Majority” based on the InfoQ Architecture Trends for 2020. It provides an alternative to REST APIs that is more focused on data, and provides a schema and a query language for clients to use. The appeal from a client perspective is clear in this State of JavaScript report. You can read GitHub’s story on why it uses GraphQL.

                    <span>Continuous integration is a coding practice where engineers deliver incremental and frequent code changes to create higher quality software and collaborate more. Teams attempting to continuously integrate new code need a consistent and automated pipeline for reviewing, testing, and deploying the changes. Otherwise change requests pile up in the queue and nothing gets integrated efficiently.

                    <span>The ability for security teams to integrate threat data into their operations substantially helps their organization identify potentially malicious endpoint and network events using indicators identified by other threat research teams. In this blog, we’ll cover how to ingest threat data with the Threat Intel Filebeat module. In future blog posts, we&#x27;ll cover enriching threat data with the Threat ECS fieldset and operationalizing threat data with Elastic Security.
 
Elastic Filebeat modules

Elastic Filebeat modules simplify the collection, parsing, and visualization of data stored in common log formats. Elastic publishes a variety of Filebeat modules that are focused on collecting the data you want for use within Elasticsearch. These modules provide a standardized and “turnkey” method to i…</span>

The InfoSec team is an extremely valuable resource who acts not only as an extension of Quality Assurance/Testing, but also as a data custodian. In fact, our internal detections team utilizes internal Elastic InfoSec data to help build and test detection rules that ultimately find their way into the Elastic Security product.
Last month, I was afforded the wonderful opportunity of “riding along” with our InfoSec team to better understand how we use Elastic internally. Over the course of three days, spread across three weeks, I saw the underbelly of our internal systems, how they are used, and ho…</span>
