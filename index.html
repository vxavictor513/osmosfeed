                    <span>On behalf of the community, I am pleased to announce that the Service Release 12 (SR12) of the Spring Cloud Hoxton Release Train is available today. The release can be found in Maven Central. You can check out the Hoxton release notes for more information.
Notable Changes in the Hoxton Release Train

See all issues included in this release here.

This was primarily a bug fix and documentation release. Hoxton.SR12 is compatible with Spring Boot 2.3.x and 2.2.x.

NOTE: This will be the last regularly scheduled release of the Hoxton Release Train. It now enters a special maintenance period for security fixes and critical bugs until the end of Feb 2022 (which follows the lifecycle of Spring Boot 2.3.x). See the wiki for more information.

                    <span>Users of Elastic Security are protected through numerous layers of protections against the REvil ransomware that affected Kaseya VSA and its customers. Elastic Security’s layered protections prevented 100% of the REvil ransomware samples tested before damage and loss could occur to the business.

We believe that detections and preventions must be layered, as no single protection works 100% of the time. There are times where detection in the SIEM/central analytics layer is the most effective, especially when you need to take signals from multiple places or correlate the activity to determine it is malicious. However, the most effective way to stop an attack is at the host. 

Prevention is paramount when it comes to ransomware. Teams cannot wait to be notified of an issue after their data is…</span>

With the goal of being “secure by default,” we are deprecating ciphers that are considered weak and insecure. Going forward, we will only support ciphers that are included in the Mozilla intermediate list. These changes will take effect after January 30, 2022. We will communicate a precise date closer to the change.

What are the changes?
We are updating the list of ciphers supported for clients connecting to their Elasticsearch clusters, Kibana, or other components on Elasticsearch Service. The changes are basically on two fronts:

Introduction

If you’re looking to get started, please head over to our reference documentation and read the “Boot Starter” section, or run the samples.

If you don’t know much about GraphQL, there are plenty of good resources. You can start at graphql.org/learn. 

GraphQL is widely adopted and in “Early Majority” based on the InfoQ Architecture Trends for 2020. It provides an alternative to REST APIs that is more focused on data, and provides a schema and a query language for clients to use. The appeal from a client perspective is clear in this State of JavaScript report. You can read GitHub’s story on why it uses GraphQL.

                    <span>Guest Author: Andy Marek, GraphQL Java founder


I am very happy to announce the creation of the Spring GraphQL project and the availability of an initial milestone towards a 1.0 release. The project integrates GraphQL Java and Spring and was developed in collaboration between both teams.

Today is GraphQL Java’s 6th birthday! One fundamental decision I made from the start was to leave any HTTP and IO aspects as a separate concern. GraphQL Java has always been “just” an engine to execute GraphQL requests. The decision has paid off but the obvious downside is the need to create your own HTTP adapter for real world usage.

This lead to the creation of a multitude of GraphQL integrations for Spring over the years, including the GraphQL Java Spring project from the GraphQL Java team.

Those meetups turned out to be just the start of a small snowball headed down a big hill, and have led to all kinds of wonderful diversity initiatives all throughout the company.

In the Business Technology team, we have worked hard to create a diverse team featuring multiple women in leadership roles, people of color, individuals who are not neurotypical, folks who struggle with mental health, and individuals who identify as part of the LGBTQ+ community.

To help ensure this commitment, we are migrating our TLS certificates to Let’s Encrypt to best support sustainable and fully automated certificate management as our product offerings and available regions continue to expand.

These changes will begin rolling out to Elastic Cloud regions beginning October 4, 2021, and are expected to be completed in all regions by October 29, 2021. 

The first region will be Azure southcentralus on October 4, 2021. After updating this region, we will pause the rollout to other regions for 14 days to allow for client validation.

                    <span>Continuous integration is a coding practice where engineers deliver incremental and frequent code changes to create higher quality software and collaborate more. Teams attempting to continuously integrate new code need a consistent and automated pipeline for reviewing, testing, and deploying the changes. Otherwise change requests pile up in the queue and nothing gets integrated efficiently.

                    <span>Today, we are excited to announce the integration of New Relic One performance monitoring in Azure Spring Cloud.

Over the past 18 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about their scenarios. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using tools that their developers are familiar with and have been using for years, and they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications which are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like New Relic. With the integration of New Relic One in Azure Spring Cloud, you can continue your journey and easily instrument your S…</span>

                    <span>The ability for security teams to integrate threat data into their operations substantially helps their organization identify potentially malicious endpoint and network events using indicators identified by other threat research teams. In this blog, we’ll cover how to ingest threat data with the Threat Intel Filebeat module. In future blog posts, we&#x27;ll cover enriching threat data with the Threat ECS fieldset and operationalizing threat data with Elastic Security.

The InfoSec team is an extremely valuable resource who acts not only as an extension of Quality Assurance/Testing, but also as a data custodian. In fact, our internal detections team utilizes internal Elastic InfoSec data to help build and test detection rules that ultimately find their way into the Elastic Security product.
Last month, I was afforded the wonderful opportunity of “riding along” with our InfoSec team to better understand how we use Elastic internally. Over the course of three days, spread across three weeks, I saw the underbelly of our internal systems, how they are used, and ho…</span>

                    <span>Kubernetes is an open source container orchestration system for automating computer application deployment, scaling, and management, and seems to have established itself as the de facto standard in this area these days. The shift from monolithic applications to microservices brought by Kubernetes has enabled faster deployment, where dynamic environments become commonplace. But on the other hand, this has made monitoring applications and their underpinning infrastructure more complex. Fortunately, Elastic has been widely used for infrastructure and application monitoring solutions for many years — both as the ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana) and more recently as Elastic Observability.

But now new research shows the cost of poor employee experiences for organizations: productivity, confidence, and opportunity.

While blended work environments are likely here to stay, 58% of 1,000 US-based knowledge workers surveyed by Wakefield Research on behalf of Elastic say searching for documents is a top work-from-home problem. Moreover, 81% say they have a hard time finding documents when a boss or client has put them in the hot seat.

                    <span>If you are a current App Search user on Swiftype.com and you’d like to move to Elastic Cloud to benefit from the latest developments — look no further! Here’s a sampling of all the long term benefits you’ll enjoy after migrating:

Faster performance, plus data locality
More flexibility and scalability 
Easier log and analytics management



	Note: If you’re not yet sure about moving you can read about the benefits of migrating. It’s also helpful to note that the planned end-of-life for Swiftype App Search is in early 2023.
	



In this blog we look at automating engine transfers from App Search on Swiftype.com to App Search on Elastic Cloud, using nothing but simple Python scripts and the available APIs. At the end of this process, you’ll be left with exactly the same engines on Elastic Cl…</span>

Software performance issues come in all shapes and sizes. Therefore, performance tuning includes many aspects and subareas, and has to adopt a broad range of methodologies and techniques. Despite all this, time is one of the most critical measurements of software performance. 

In this multi-part series, I’ll focus on a few of the time-related aspects of software performance — particularly for security software. Each post in this series will focus on a single topic, including how to identify performance issues, how to fix them, and how to avoid them in future.

                    <span>In a previous blog, we covered how you can incorporate synonyms into your Elasticsearch-powered application. Here, I build upon that blog and show how you can combine stemmers and multi-word synonyms to take the quality of your search results to the next level. 
 
Motivation

Imagine that you are using Elasticsearch to power a search application for finding books, and in this application you want to treat the following words as synonyms:

brainstorm
brainstorming
brainstormed
brain storm
brain storming
brain stormed
envisage
envisaging
envisaged
etc.
It is tedious and error prone to explicitly use synonyms to define all possible conjugations, declensions, and inflections of a word or of a compound word.

However, it is possible to reduce the size of the list of synonyms by making use of a …</span>

This week was no exception. I joined the my buddy Matt Raible and Brian Demeers today for the OktaDev Twitch channel and we hacked on making the Spring Boot starter for Okta work with Spring Native. The goal is that you should be able to bring your application unchanged with Spring Native, and this is yet another example of that working. We didn’t know what issues we were going to face, but we managed to figure out the relatively minor things required to make it work within an hour and within two hours we had most a working, standalone “hints” .jar dependency that users can add to their spring-aot plugins dependencies. Hopefully they…</span>
