Large pre-trained language models, which are continuing to grow in size, achieve state-of-art results on many natural language processing (NLP) benchmarks. Since the development of GPT and BERT, standard practice has been to fine-tune models on downstream tasks, which involves adjusting every weight in the network (i.e., model tuning). However, as models become larger, storing and serving a tuned copy of the model for each downstream task becomes impractical. 
 An appealing alternative is to share across all downstream tasks a single frozen pre-trained language model, in which all weights are fixed. In an exciting development, GPT-3 showed convincingly that a frozen model can be conditio…</span>

With the release of 8.0, Elastic is excited to introduce the ability to upload PyTorch machine learning models into Elasticsearch to provide modern natural language processing (NLP) in the Elastic Stack. Now Elasticsearch users are able to integrate one of the most popular formats for building NLP models and incorporate those models as part of an NLP data pipeline into Elasticsearch with our Inference processor. The ability to add PyTorch models, along with new ANN search APIs, adds a whole new vector (pun intended) to Elastic Enterprise Search.

In 8.0, we are excited to bring simplified security features to all of our users. Starting in 7.1, we made all the features that are required to keep your Elastic Stack secure available for free to everyone.
Yet, we know that setting up security is no fun and that you need to focus on your project goals. Good news for you! As of 8.0, Elastic Stack security is on by default for self-managed clusters, with next-to-zero configuration effort. Just spin up the new Elasticsearch and Kibana release and continue making the most of the Elastic Stack, we&#x27;ve got your back! If you’re using the Elastic Cloud, not to worry — we already take care of security for you. 
All the security you need with none of the hassle,
Simplified security includes the following features, which span across multiple layer…</span>

In visual understanding, the Vision Transformer (ViT) and its variants have received significant attention recently due to their superior performance on many core visual applications, such as image classification, object detection, and video understanding. The core idea of ViT is to utilize the power of self-attention layers to learn global relationships between small patches of images. However, the number of connections between patches increases quadratically with image size. Such a design has been observed to be data inefficient — although the original ViT can perform better than convolutional networks with hundreds of millions of images for pre-training, such a data requirement is not always practical, and it sti…</span>

Collections have been fully supported since Ansible 2.9 and for the last 2 years, the Ansible community has been on a journey to move to this new way of packaging and consuming Ansible content. With Ansible 2.9, Collections were optional, but as of 2.10 they are a requirement. The ability to be able to install and use Collections as needed is increasingly important.</span>

Organizations are increasingly moving to the cloud to tap into more flexible, affordable, and scalable infrastructure. Elastic can be deployed across on-premises and cloud environments to help people find what they need faster, monitor mission-critical applications, and protect against cyber threats. 
When deciding on the optimal environment to deploy Elastic workloads, there are several essential factors that CIOs, IT managers, and cloud engineers should consider — elasticity, security, cost, reliability, and geographic coverage. 
In this blog, we will discuss how these five characteristics of cloud computing can be leveraged to maximize your Elastic experience and achieve the best return on your investment.

Adding nodes to an Elasticsearch cluster allows it to scale to enormous workloads. It is critical to understand the optimal ways to expand the Elasticsearch cluster so not to impair performance.
Elasticsearch is a fast and powerful search technology. As your data grows you will need to take advantage of it’s impressive scalability. Adding more nodes to a cluster not only increases how much data the cluster can hold, it improves how many requests it handles at once, and reduces the time needed to return results–usually. 
It makes for one terrible weekend trying to uncover why adding nodes to your Elasticsearch cluster caused instability, downtime, mounting frustration and lost revenue. So let’s discuss some common configurations where scaling up a cluster can hit significant performance b…</span>

People learn to do things by watching others — from mimicking new dance moves, to watching YouTube cooking videos. We’d like robots to do the same, i.e., to learn new skills by watching people do things during training. Today, however, the predominant paradigm for teaching robots is to remote control them using specialized hardware for teleoperation and then train them to imitate pre-recorded demonstrations. This limits both who can provide the demonstrations (programmers &amp; roboticists) and where they can be provided (lab settings). If robots could instead self-learn new tasks by watching humans, this capability could allow them to be deployed in more unstructured settings like the home, and ma…</span>

Continuing advances in the design and implementation of datacenter (DC) accelerators for machine learning (ML), such as TPUs and GPUs, have been critical for powering modern ML models and applications at scale. These improved accelerators exhibit peak performance (e.g., FLOPs) that is orders of magnitude better than traditional computing systems. However, there is a fast-widening gap between the available peak performance offered by state-of-the-art hardware and the actual achieved performance when ML models run on that hardware.  
 One approach to address this gap is to design hardware-specific ML models that optimize both performance (e.g., throughput and latency) and model quality. Recen…</span>

There has been a surge of interest in vector search, thanks to a new generation of machine learning models that can represent all sorts of content as vectors, including text, images, events, and more. Often called “embedding models”, these powerful representations can capture similarity between two pieces of content in a way that goes beyond their surface level characteristics.
k-nearest neighbor (kNN) search algorithms find the vectors in a dataset that are most similar to a query vector. Paired with these vector representations, kNN search opens up exciting possibilities for retrieval:

Finding passages likely to contain the answer to a question
Detecting near-duplicate images in a large dataset
Finding songs that sound similar to a given song


Vector search is poised to become an imp…</span>

Elastic Enterprise Search is a product that uses the power of Elasticsearch over datasets — so that data will always be accessible, no matter its location. Enterprise Search leverages Kibana and Elasticsearch to let you index all your data. 
Enterprise Search is composed of two distinct sets of features: App Search and Workplace Search. App Search provides APIs and dashboard controls for building powerful search experiences. Workplace Search connects to third-party services to index data so that you can have a unified search experience.
Technically speaking, the Enterprise Search stack is a Ruby On Rails application that uses Elasticsearch as its database and leverages the Kibana User Interface (UI). Historically, the application had a UI, but most of it has been merged into Kibana (plug…</span>

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring Shell 2.1.0-M2 has been released and is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

We previously had a milestone M1, named 3.0.0-M1 which we soon after its release realised that it was a mistake to pump major version for this rework to make codebase better for Spring Boot 2.x. We want to avoid confusing versioning when spring-shell upgrades and baselines with Spring Boot 3.x. Thus having said that, Spring Shell 2.1.x is going to be for Spring Boot 2.6.x and future Spring Shell 3.x for Spring Boot 3.x.

Notable changes include:

As businesses accelerate digital transformations and cloud adoption to better serve customers and employees in the face of the global pandemic, operational complexity has also mounted. To untangle these complexities  and enable executive visibility into IT ecosystem , business leaders are increasingly looking to observability solutions as a strategic investment. 
1. Observability is a critical business initiative,
With customers and employees increasingly going digital, businesses need to innovate faster with increased adoption of cloud and cloud-native technologies. Keeping cloud applications running effectively has also become significantly more difficult. Organizations continue to struggle with a lot of data, but few are able to extract actionable insights.

I bet we all have heard so much about eBPF in recent years. Data shows that eBPF is quickly becoming the first choice for implementing tracing and security applications, and Elastic is also working relentlessly on supercharging our security solutions (and more) with eBPF.

                    <span>Posted by Chelsea Finn, Research Adviser and Eric Jang, Senior Research Scientist, Robotics at Google 
People can flexibly maneuver objects in their physical surroundings to accomplish various goals. One of the grand challenges in robotics is to successfully train robots to do the same, i.e., to develop a general-purpose robot capable of performing a multitude of tasks based on arbitrary user commands. Robots that are faced with the real world will also inevitably encounter new user instructions and situations that were not seen during training. Therefore, it is imperative for robots to be trained to perform multiple tasks in a variety of situations and, more importantly, to be capable of solving new tasks as requested by human users, even if the robot was not explicitly trained on those t…</span>

Machine learning (ML) models are becoming increasingly valuable for improved performance across a variety of consumer products, from recommendations to automatic image classification.  However, despite aggregating large amounts of data, in theory it is possible for models to encode characteristics of individual entries from the training set.  For example, experiments in controlled settings have shown that language models trained using email datasets may sometimes encode sensitive information included in the training data and may have the potential to reveal the presence of a particular user’s data in the training set. As such, it is important to prevent the encoding of such charac…</span>

Deep neural networks (DNNs) provide more accurate results as the size and coverage of their training data increases. While investing in high-quality and large-scale labeled datasets is one path to model improvement, another is leveraging prior knowledge, concisely referred to as “rules” — reasoning heuristics, equations, associative logic, or constraints. Consider a common example from physics where a model is given the task of predicting the next state in a double pendulum system. While the model may learn to estimate the total energy of the system at a given point in time only from empirical data, it will frequently overestimate the energy unless also provided an equation th…</span>

Deep machine learning (ML) systems have achieved considerable success in medical image analysis in recent years. One major contributing factor is access to abundant labeled datasets, which are used to train highly effective supervised deep learning models. However, in the real-world, these models may encounter samples exhibiting rare conditions that are individually too infrequent for per-condition classification. Nevertheless, such conditions can be collectively common because they follow a long-tail distribution and when taken together can represent a significant portion of cases — e.g., in a recent deep learning dermatological study, hundreds of rare conditions composed around 20%…</span>

Quantum processors are made of superconducting quantum bits (qubits) that — being quantum objects — are highly susceptible to even tiny amounts of environmental noise. This noise can cause errors in quantum computation that need to be addressed to continue advancing quantum computers. Our Sycamore processors are installed in specially designed cryostats, where they are sealed away from stray light and electromagnetic fields and are cooled down to very low temperatures to reduce thermal noise.  
However, the world is full of high-energy radiation. In fact, there’s a tiny background of high-energy gamma rays and muons that pass through everything around u…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Can you believe it’s already the 25th of the first month of a brand new year!? And we’re fast approaching the Lunar New Year, often also called the Chinese New Year, which will arrive next Tuesday. Reunion dinner will be on the 31st of January, and the two weeks of celebration will begin. All that to say that this is my last real chance, speaking I’m sure for the entire Tanzu team, to wish everyone around the planet (billions of people!) who celebrates a very happy Lunar New Year (Mandarin: 新年快乐 (pronounced: xin nian kauai le ) / Cantonese: 新年快乐 (pronounced: san nin fai lok )) and to say that we hope you enjoy prosperity in the new year (Mandarin: 恭喜发财 (pronounced: gong xi fa cai) / Cantonese: 恭喜发财 (pronounced: gong hei fat choy))! 

That said, let’s get into this week’s …</span>

Image matting is the process of extracting a precise alpha matte that separates foreground and background objects in an image. This technique has been traditionally used in the filmmaking and photography industry for image and video editing purposes, e.g., background replacement, synthetic bokeh and other visual effects. Image matting assumes that an image is a composite of foreground and background images, and hence, the intensity of each pixel is a linear combination of the foreground and the background.  
   
In the case of traditional image segmentation, the image is segmented in a binary manner, in which a pixel either belongs to the foreground or background. This type of segmentation, however, is unab…</span>

Birds are all around us, and just by listening, we can learn many things about our environment. Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and forest health — for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, that means there’s a lot of dead wood. Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear. In fact, experts may identify up to 10x as many birds by ear as by sight. 
In recent years, autonomous recording units (ARUs) have made it easy to capture thousands of hours of audio in forests that could be used to better understand ecosystems and identify critical habitat. However, manually reviewing the audio data is very time co…</span>

Language models are becoming more capable than ever before and are helpful in a variety of tasks — translating one language into another, summarizing a long document into a brief highlight, or answering information-seeking questions. Among these, open-domain dialog, where a model needs to be able to converse about any topic, is probably one of the most difficult, with a wide range of potential applications and open challenges. In addition to producing responses that humans judge as sensible, interesting, and specific to the context, dialog models should adhere to Responsible AI practices, and avoid making factual statements that are not supported by external …</span>

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring Boot 3.0.0-M1 has been released and is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

This milestone starts our exciting journey to the next generation of the Spring Framework and raises our baseline from Java 8 to Java 17. We are planning to release a new milestone of Spring Boot 3.0 every two months. M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.

If you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.

We’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.

Please see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.

If you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.

                    <span>This is the fourth article of a series about how to tackle various challenges you might encounter when using Spring Data JDBC.
The series consists of:





Spring Data JDBC - How to Use Custom ID Generation.



Spring Data JDBC - How Do I Make Bidirectional Relationships?



Spring Data JDBC - How Do I Implement Caching?



Spring Data JDBC - How Can I Do a Partial Update of an Aggregate Root? (this article)





If you are new to Spring Data JDBC, you should start by reading introduction and this article, which explains the relevance of aggregates in the context of Spring Data JDBC. Trust me. It is important.



Spring Data JDBC is built around the idea of aggregates and repositories.

This first milestone includes a number of major changes such as requiring Java 17+, migrating to Jakarta EE 9 APIs as well as upgrading our dependencies across the portfolio to major versions such as Spring Framework 6.0. For a complete list of changes, please check the change log.

We also took the opportunity of this major version to remove deprecated APIs and fix some issues that require non backward compatible changes. The migration guide contains more details about these changes and provides the upgrade instructions.

As we continue our work on Spring Batch 5, we look forward to your feedback on this first milestone!

The M5 release is a quick follow-on after the feature-rich M4 release from December. The main goal for M5 was to move the Boot starter out of the Spring GraphQL repository and into Spring Boot proper, ahead of the first Spring Boot 2.7 milestone this Thursday. In addition to that, as always, there was plenty of feedback leading to a number of refinements and fixes.

The GraphQL starter has moved out of the Spring for GraphQL project repository and into the Spring Boot repository, from where it will be made available in the upcoming 2.7.0-M1 release. Here is the GraphQL section in the Spring B…</span>

Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another —  is often a mystery. Explaining a neural model’s decision process may have high social impact in certain areas, such as analysis of medical images and autonomous driving, where human oversight is critical. These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery.

Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements in natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost incre…</span>

Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil…</span>
