                    <span>Dear Spring community,

On behalf of the Spring Data team and everyone who contributed, it is my pleasure to announce that Spring Data 2021.1.0 has entered its release candidate phase by releasing RC1 today. It is available from the milestone repository. This release ships with several tickets fixed. The most notable changes are:


  
Deprecate support for RxJava 2 in preparation for removal of RxJava 2 support with Spring Data 3.0.

  
Fluent Query API for Querydsl and Query-by-Example, allowing for projections, pagination, and consuming results as a Stream.

  
Spring Data JDBC ships with a refined SQL DSL, accepting complex JOIN conditions and subselects.

  
Support for exists and not empty keywords in Elasticsearch repository query methods and support for field exclusion in sour…</span>

                    <span>This is the third article of a series about how to tackle various challenges you might encounter when using Spring Data JDBC.



The series consists of





Spring Data JDBC - How to use custom ID generation.



Spring Data JDBC - How do I make bidirectional relationships?



Spring Data JDBC - How do I implement caching? (this article).





If you are new to Spring Data JDBC, you should start by reading its introduction and this article, which explains the relevance of aggregates in the context of Spring Data JDBC. Trust me, it is important.



This article is based on part of a talk I did at Spring One 2021.

I’ve got a lot of fun Spring Tips installments lined up or in production at the moment, and I can’t wait for you to see ’em!

How are you doin’, otherwise? I hope you’re doing well! 

Now then, we’ve got a lot to cover and oh-so little time in which to do it. Let’s goo! 


  
In this installment of Spring Tips, I look at “Bootiful Edge Services” with Spring GraphQL, Spring Cloud Gateway, and Reactive Programming.

                    <span>While developing Elasticsearch, we occasionally come across an important problem with no simple or established approach to solving it. It&#x27;s natural to ask “hmm, is there an academic paper that addresses this?” Other times, academic work is a source of inspiration. We&#x27;ll encounter a paper proposing a new algorithm or data structure and think “this would be so useful!” Here are just a few examples of how Elasticsearch and Apache Lucene incorporate academic work:

HyperLogLog++ for cardinality aggregations
C3 algorithm for adaptive replica selection
Hierarchical Navigable Small World Graphs (HNSW) for nearest vector search in Lucene
MIC statistic to improve machine learning classification
Block-max WAND for faster top-hits retrieval in Lucene
... and many more
Academic papers are an invaluabl…</span>

Configuring CCS

Getting the Security app to work with CCS only requires a few minor changes. The first step is to configure the Security app so that it knows to look for the CCS index patterns instead of local index patterns. To do this open the Kibana ‘Advanced Settin…</span>

This allows customers to simplify their data pipeline architecture, eliminate operational overhead, and reduce the time required for troubleshooting.

                    <span>Elastic Observability 7.15 introduces the general availability of automated correlations, unified views across application service logs and dependencies, and agentless log ingestion from Google Cloud Platform (GCP), accelerating troubleshooting of root causes of application issues and making it even easier to ingest telemetry from cloud services. 

These new features allow customers to:

Automatically surface attributes of the APM data set that are correlated with high-latency or erroneous transactions
Effortlessly troubleshoot application issues by viewing all associated application or service logs from within the APM user interface 
Seamlessly ingest log data into Elastic from within the Google Cloud console and extend monitoring to native Google Cloud services

                    <span>Elastic Security 7.15 further arms the SOC to achieve extended detection and response (XDR). 
Malicious behavior protection applies behavior analytics to prevent attack techniques often leveraged by named threats by performing dynamic, stateful correlation of on-host events, and then reacting instantly to disrupt attacks before they cause damage.
Memory threat protection now safeguards Windows hosts, stopping attacks designed to evade most other defenses.
To accelerate response and prevent damage and loss, 7.15 adds host isolation for cloud-native Linux systems, making the capability now available on every OS protected by Elastic Agent. 
Let’s dive in.

                    <span>AzureFunBytes is a weekly opportunity to learn more about the fundamentals and foundations that make up Azure. It’s a chance for me to understand more about what people across the Azure organization do and how they do it. Every week we get together at 11 AM Pacific on Microsoft LearnTV and learn more about Azure.
