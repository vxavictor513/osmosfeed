                    <span>When automating processes you typically integrate systems and services, or in other words you orchestrate various APIs. In order to achieve this you not only have different technical possibilities, but also can choose between various modeling possibilities in BPMN. This post will give you an overview and advice on how to decide between alternatives.

                    <span>Greetings Spring community,



The Spring Web Services team has released 3.1.1. This is the first major release under the new versioning schema. Releases will no longer have .RELEASE and snapshots will only be -SNAPSHOT, to better comply with community approaches.



While we strive to maintain alignment with Spring Framework and Spring Security, we also test against Java 8, Java 11, and Java LATEST (JDK 16 as of today).

While these techniques can appear normal in isolation, they start looking suspicious when observed in the parent-child context. This is where the ProblemChild framework can help.

                    <span>Alibaba Cloud is an important partner to us here at Elastic. We officially started our collaboration and strategic partnership with Alibaba Cloud back in 2017, when we announced the Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch service. Since then, we’ve seen rapid adoption and growth of the service, which now supports more than 10 petabytes of data.

                    <span>In HashiCorp Packer 1.7, we tagged HCL2 as stable and implemented HCL2-only functions. You can use one such function, the templatefile function to build multiple operating systems with less duplication of configuration.
Currently, you need to use the boot_command argument to configure an OS before you connect to the machine. You can use it with many builders, including the vmware-iso or virtualbox-iso builders. A boot_command mimicks manual keystrokes and sends them at a regular cadence. You aggregate these…</span>

                    <span>Large portions of software development budgets are dedicated for testing code. A new component may take weeks to thoroughly test, and even then mistakes happen. If you consider software defects as security issues then the concern goes well beyond an application temporarily crashing. Although even minor bugs can cost companies a lot of time to

                    <span>Terraform Cloud’s Business Tier offering allows you to manage resources in private data centers using self-hosted agents. The standard Terraform Cloud setup requires that any resources managed by remote execution are accessible over public internet. With agents, you can also manage infrastructure in private environments without modifying your network perimeter to allow for public ingress. The agent runs within your environment and polls Terraform Cloud for workloads to execute. It is available as both a Doc…</span>
