                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! It’s September 14th! I can’t believe it. I know this is a common refrain on my weekly posts, but can you believe it’s already nearly Fall and Winter? What is happening?? How’d we get here so quickly? 

Anyway, how are you doin’? I’m doing alright! It’s been kinda a crazy week. I was in the studio all day and some of the night yesterday filming a new Livelessons video that I can’t wait for y’all to see. (But be forewarned: there will be .YAML!) 

Then, at 3am my time, I did a presentation for the Japanese Java User Group. This would be one thing in of itself, but what made this special for me was that I was supposed to appear at the JJUG six weeks ago. Yes, that six weeks ago. The same six weeks ago when I was convalescing with COVID-19, six weeks ago. Needless to say (bu…</span>

                    <span>It has been a while since Spring Framework 5.3 was released.
One of the features in that release was a major overhaul of our Reactive Multipart support.
In this blog post, we share some of the knowledge learned while working on this feature.
Specifically, we focus on finding a token within a stream of byte buffers.



Multipart Form Data



Whenever you upload a file, your browser sends it — and other fields in the form — to the server as a multipart/form-data message.
The exact format of these messages is described in RFC 7578.
If you submit a simple form with a single text field called foo and a file selector called file, the multipart/form-data message looks something like this:




POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary&#x3D;&quot;boundary&quot; …</span>

                    <span>Why OpenTelemetry?
Open Telemetry represents an effort to combine distributed tracing, metrics and logging into a single set of system components and language-specific libraries. Recently, OpenTelemetry became a CNCF incubating project, but it already enjoys quite a significant community and vendor support. OpenTelemetry defines itself as “an observability framework for cloud-native software”, although it should be able to cover more than what we know as “cloud-native software”. Quoting its mission statement, “OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools, APIs, and SDKs” that are used “to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) for analysis to understand the software&#x27;s performance and behaviour”.

We at Elastic find the mission statement of OpenTeleme…</span>

At Smarter City Solutions, which provides tens of thousands of drivers in Australia and New Zealand real-time parking related services through the flagship Smarter Parking Platform, our engineering team faced this challenge when scaling from a few deployments to dozens. Whether it was a scaling issue in infrastructure, a configuration gap in the server, or an update needed in an application, we realized that proactive, unified visibility of the entire stack to detect potential issues was critical if we wanted to ensure a consistent customer experience as we continue to grow.

Java 17+ (from Java 8-17 in the Spring Framework 5.3.x line)

  
Jakarta EE 9+ (from Java EE 7-8 in the Spring Framework 5.3.x line)


This forward-looking baseline will provide significant benefits in our API design and integration efforts, shining through to your application code and future-proofing the framework as well as your applications for many years to come. However, it comes at a cost, of course: Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3 based applications will require a minimum of JDK 17 at runtime, as well as a minimum of Tomcat 10 / Jetty 11 (for Jakarta EE 9 compatibility).

As the Industrial Age Army transforms to the Information Age Army, Army leadership recognizes the need for adaptable technologies that enable data exchange at the tactical edge. Not only must these technologies be in lock step with the 8 guiding principles of the DoD Data Strategy, but they must also deliver on the Army’s data imperatives of speed, scale and resilience.

                    <span>Today, we are excited to announce the integration of the Dynatrace Software Intelligence Platform in Azure Spring Cloud.

Over the past 18 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about the scenarios they face. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using solutions their developers are familiar with and have been using for years. In addition, they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications that are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like Dynatrace OneAgent, which automatically discovers and maps all applications, microservices, and infrastruct…</span>

                    <span>Less than 2 months after the initial announcement of Spring GraphQL and its follow up intro blog,
I’m happy to announce that the 1.0.0-M2 version has been released and is available from the Spring Milestone repository.

The Spring GraphQL team would like to thank the early adopters and contributors - with your help, we’re making good progress towards a GA version!

We’ve fixed a few issues and renamed a couple of concepts, but the most notable change is the introduction of a new annotation model for GraphQL Controllers.
You can now annotate @Controller components to handle queries, mutations and subscriptions:

@Controller
public class GreetingController {

        @QueryMapping 
        public String hello() { 
            return &quot;Hello, world!&quot;;
        }

}


This is a new feature and we can’t wait to hear your feedback - please give it a try and let us know what you think!
Spring GraphQL at SpringOne!

Don’t miss the Spring GraphQL presentation at SpringOne today!
This will give a nice intro to this new Spring project and you’ll get a chance to chat with the team, live and on the dedicated SpringOne Slack.
How can you help?

If you’re interested in helping out, you can get started with Spring GraphQL and raise issues on our GitHub project.
If you have general questions, please ask on stackoverflow.com using the spring-graphql tag.

                    <span>On August 21, 2021, the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) released an urgent notice related to the exploitation of ProxyShell vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-31207, CVE-2021-34473, CVE-2021-34523).  By chaining these vulnerabilities together, threat actors are compromising unpatched Microsoft Exchange servers and gaining footholds into enterprise networks. Security vendors and researchers are also observing these attacks tied to post-exploitation behavior such as deploying ransomware to victim environments.  
  
Elastic Security identified indicators of compromise (IoCs) indicating similar activity as reported by the industry. The details of this activity can be found in our Discuss forum, highlighting our perspective of what we have observed in our own telemetry. 
  
Please visit the Discuss forum for full details on our identified IoCs.</span>

                    <span>or: How To Build a Mental Framework for Spring Framework

EDIT: There’s a great comment below that mentions that the original title, Structuring Spring Boot Applications, is a bit misleading, in that the blog doesn’t intend to talk about how to organize types and packages, and instead thinks about how Spring interacts with the objects in your code. The next paragraph sought to clarify that point but apparently fell short. Anyway, I’ve changed it, which unfortunately will break earlier links to it. I’m sorry for both the poor title and the now two days of broken links. I hope it’s useful for everyone, even if I clearly could’ve done a better job with the title…

                    <span>Since its inception, Elastic Security has had a clear mission: to protect the world&#x27;s data and systems from attack.

We started with SIEM, built on top of the Elastic Stack, applying its fast and scalable search capabilities to detect security vulnerabilities across all threat vectors. Next, we joined forces with Endgame to integrate endpoint security into Elastic Security, and allow customers to prevent, detect, and respond to attacks from a single, unified platform. With the recent release of Elastic Security Limitless XDR and the general availability of Elastic Agent, we furthered our mission.

Today, we are excited to announce the next step in the Elastic Security journey: to extend security enforcement from every endpoint to every cloud workload.

                    <span>Kibana creates easy ways to do powerful things with all of your data — to ask and answer questions and follow the flow of analysis. Many times the answer to your question requires calculations based on queried data. Formulas allow you to author your own metrics by combining multiple aggregated fields using math operations.

In addition, moving through and replaying your data in time and space are powerful ways to gain historical context and understand additional insight about the present.

In the below sections you’ll find 10 examples of questions you can answer with dashboard data and map visualizations in Kibana via formulas, time shifts, and moving through data in time.
