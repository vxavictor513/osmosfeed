Machine learning (ML) agents are increasingly deployed in the real world to make decisions and assist people in their daily lives. Making reasonable predictions about the future at varying timescales is one of the most important capabilities for such agents because it enables them to predict changes in the world around them, including other agents’ behaviors, and plan how to act next. Importantly, successful future prediction requires both capturing meaningful transitions in the environment (e.g., dough transforming into bread) and adapting to how transitions unfold over time in order to make decisions.

When building a deep model for a new machine learning application, researchers often begin with existing network architectures, such as ResNets or EfficientNets. If the initial model’s accuracy isn’t high enough, a larger model may be a tempting alternative, but may not actually be the best solution for the task at hand. Instead, better performance potentially could be achieved by designing a new model that is optimized for the task. However, such efforts can be challenging and usually require considerable resources.  
In “Wisdom of Committees: An Overlooked Approach to Faster and More Accurate Models”,  we discuss model ensembles and a subset called model cascades, both of which…</span>

The search experience on your website is often the key driver of visitor satisfaction. Even on well-designed, well-organized websites, visitors frequently resort to search to find the exact products, services, content, and information they need. In fact, many visitors go immediately to the search box. The quality of search results they get back, and the ease with which they can customize and filter those results, can play an outsized role in engagement, conversion, and customer loyalty.

In recent years, Observability has become a de-facto standard when discussing development and maintenance of cloud-native applications. The need to develop an observable system and ensure that as it runs in production, engineers will be able to detect performance issues, downtimes, and service disruptions, has evolved into a rich ecosystem of tools and practices.

The Elastic Observability platform has been a trailblazer in this ecosystem, providing a one-stop shop for collecting logs, trace inf…</span>

Earlier this year, we launched Contactless Sleep Sensing in Nest Hub, an opt-in feature that can help users better understand their sleep patterns and nighttime wellness. While some of the most critical sleep insights can be derived from a person’s overall schedule and duration of sleep, that alone does not tell the complete story. The human brain has special neurocircuitry to coordinate sleep cycles — transitions between deep, light, and rapid eye movement (REM) stages of sleep — vital not only for physical and emotional wellbeing, but also for optimal physical and cognitive performance.

California, the state where I live, dearly needs the rain, so it’s a positive, I suppose. But it still feels miserable. Between the daylights savings time shortening the daylight significantly and the rain, it’s a gloomy kind of day. At least there’s a lot of good stuff to read! Let’s dive right into it!

This fall Pixel 6 phones launched with Google Tensor, Google’s first mobile system-on-chip (SoC), bringing together various processing components (such as central/graphic/tensor processing units, image processors, etc.) onto a single chip, custom-built to deliver state-of-the-art innovations in machine learning (ML) to Pixel users. In fact, every aspect of Google Tensor was designed and optimized to run Google’s ML models, in alignment with our AI Principles. That starts with the custom-made TPU integrated in Google Tensor that allows us to fulfill our vision of what should be possible on a Pixel phone.

As higher education institutions operate in a changed world, IT leaders in education continue to work through issues that came to the forefront during the pandemic. 
Educational technology plays a big role, especially when it comes to equitable access to education. But IT leaders are also focusing on the back end, and leveraging analytics to inform their decision making as they restore, evolve, or transform digital ecosystems for increasingly blended learning environments.
Three areas where analytics from the existing digital ecosystem enable a better student experience are: online learning, cost management, and cyber and information security. Whether IT leaders tackle one or all three, they have the ability to make a lasting impact using the Elastic search and analytics platform.

For more than 70 years, plasma physicists have dreamed of controlled “breakeven” fusion, where a system is capable of releasing more energy in a fusion reaction than it takes to initiate and sustain those reactions. The challenge is that the reactor must create a plasma at a temperature of tens of millions of degrees, which requires a highly complex, finely tuned system to confine and sustain. Further, creating the plasma and maintaining it, requires substantial amounts of energy, which, to date, have exceeded that released in the fusion reaction itself. Nevertheless, if a “breakeven” system could be achieved, it could provide ample zero-carbon electricity, the potential impact of which has driven interest by government…</span>

We all want to work for a company where we fit in. That’s why Elastic built a Source Code
 that encourages all to come as they are. In the Someone Like Me blog 
series, we highlight Elasticians who have a unique story — one, perhaps,
 just as unique as yours.
In this edition, we meet Yannick Fhima, Senior Manager, Solutions 
Architecture, EMEA South who although was born with a disability, was

As observed products and services evolve or their authors introduce new features, it’s essential to preserve compatibility between the product and the corresponding integration and detect inconsistencies as soon as possible.
At Elastic, we use the elastic-package on a daily basis to create and maintain integrations. Today, we&#x27;ll review existing testing methods for integrations and learn how to verify integrity between Elastic Agent and observed products.
Review following testing methods and adopt them in your integrations to increase test coverage for pipelines, manifests, fields, etc. Adopting at least a few of them will prevent hours of manual testing and bug hunting.

Each year, companies pour more money into their cybersecurity budgets — more than $262 billion collectively in 2021, up from just $3.5 billion about 20 years ago. Yet every year, the attacks, breaches, and losses continue to increase. Employing the same tactics while expecting different results is not a rational approach to managing cybersecurity risk. 
Some security tactics, of course — defining acceptable levels of risk, using liability insurance to transfer some of that risk, and mitigating damage when it happens — remain important in reducing the impact of attacks. Yet, business leaders need to rethink their organizational strategy. Enterprise security is too important to be the sole purview of a handful of specialists, as it has been for years. It needs to be enmeshed into everyone&#x27;…</span>

“The Great Resignation” of 2021 has upped the stakes for CIOs in an already cutthroat market for IT talent: Nearly 3 in 4 IT workers are considering quitting their jobs in the next 12 months, well above the rate for all U.S. workers. 
That means CIOs often must go beyond competitive salaries and great benefits to recruit and retain the talent they need. But what are the most effective ways to entice the most sought-after IT professionals?
To get a front-line perspective, we interviewed a group of experienced professionals in various IT roles to get their insights about the market for talent. Here are some highlights of those conversations, which have been edited for clarity and length.

                    <span>Posted by Johan Ferret, Student Researcher, Google Research, Brain Team    
An approach commonly used to train agents for a range of applications from robotics to chip design is reinforcement learning (RL). While RL excels at discovering how to solve tasks from scratch, it can struggle in training an agent to understand the reversibility of its actions, which can be crucial to ensure that agents behave in a safe manner within their environment. For instance, robots are generally costly and require maintenance, so one wants to avoid taking actions that might lead to broken components. Estimating if an action is reversible or not (or better, how easily it can be reversed) requires a working knowledge of the physics of the environment in which the agent is operating. However, in the standard …</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How’re you doin’? I’ve been busy as all get out emceeing the Reactive Summit 2021 event (it’s free and it’s online!). The event has been awe-inspiring because there are so many amazing speakers from all walks of life present and speaking. Today, the conference welcomed professor Carl Hewitt, the creator of the Actor Paradigm, as its keynote. Then, figuring there was no topping that and figuring they could go for broke, they foolishly ( muahahah! ) asked me to do the day two keynote. So, I’ll be doing tomorrow’s keynote with my friend and Google Developer Advocate James Ward. Join us! It’ll be super fun! 

We’ve got a ton of stuff to get to this week though, so let’s dive right into it!

Emotions are a key aspect of social interactions, influencing the way people behave and shaping relationships. This is especially true with language — with only a few words, we&#x27;re able to express a wide variety of subtle and complex emotions. As such, it’s been a long-term goal among the research community to enable machines to understand context and emotion, which would, in turn, enable a variety of applications, including empathetic chatbots, models to detect harmful online behavior, and improved customer support interactions. 
In the past decade, the NLP research community has made available several datasets for language-based emotion classification. The majority of those are constructed manually and cover targete…</span>

                    <span>The Spring GraphQL team is pleased to announce a 3rd milestone towards a 1.0.0 release, driven with great help from the community .
Batch Mapping

The 2nd milestone introduced an annotation programming model for GraphQL data controllers with @SchemaMapping methods. The 3rd milestone adds a new @BatchMapping method.

If you’re familiar with GraphQL, you know that navigating an object graph can cause the “N+1 queries problem” if we’re not mapping carefully object relations. We could already leverage the Batching feature from GraphQL Java to solve that problem, but this release introduces dedicated support as well as an @BatchMapping annotation for a smoother experience:

Despite the success and widespread adoption of smartphones, using them to compose longer pieces of text is still quite cumbersome. As one writes, grammatical errors can often creep into the text (especially undesirable in formal situations), and correcting these errors can be time consuming on a small display with limited controls. 
  
To address some of these challenges, we are launching a grammar correction feature that is directly built into Gboard on Pixel 6 that works entirely on-device to preserve privacy, detecting and suggesting corrections for grammatical errors while the user is typing. Building such functionality required addressing a few key obstacles: memory …</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How are you? 

I’m doing well, as always. I literally just wrapped up presenting a fun session at the Russian Joker conference all about Spring and GraphQL. I got a ton of great questions from an enthusiastic audience. Thanks so much for joining me, everyone. I’ve got to get to other meetings, though, so let’s get this wonderful week in Spring out of the way!

                    <span>On behalf of the community, I am pleased to announce that Spring Cloud OpenFeign versions 2.2.10.RELEASE, 3.0.5 and 3.1.0-M4 have been released.

These are primarily security releases with fixes for the CVE-2021-22044. 

Applications using type-level @RequestMappingannotations over Feign client interfaces, can be involuntarily exposing endpoints corresponding to @RequestMapping-annotated interface methods. Although a response is not returned for a request sent in this way, it does reach the corresponding server-side endpoint.

The practice of using a type-level @RequestMapping on a Feign client interface has been discouraged in the documentation, but we’re now taking the step to reject it completely.

These versions will be picked up later by the 2020.0.x and 2021.0.x release trains, however, we recommend you already upgrade Spring Cloud OpenFeign in your projects to these most recent versions.

No additional issues were included for 3.0.5.</span>

                    <span>When we got the results back from the latest State Of Spring survey, 67% of you said you would like to see better support for service discovery and configuration management on Kubernetes.

With the release of Spring Cloud 2021.0.0-M3, we are taking a big step forward to addressing both of these concerns!

Spring Cloud Kubernetes has offered a DiscoveryClient implementation since its inception. However, the implementation required the application to have permissions to use the Kubernetes API server. This proved to be a major barrier for many Spring Cloud user’s, as Kubernetes administrators were hesitant to give apps permissions to make API requests to the Kubernetes API server.

Configuration management using Spring Cloud Kubernetes also suffered from the same requirement of needing acc…</span>

Many machine learning (ML) models typically focus on learning one task at a time. For example, language models predict the probability of a next word given a context of past words, and object detection models identify the object(s) that are present in an image. However, there may be instances when learning from many related tasks at the same time would lead to better modeling performance. This is addressed in the domain of multi-task learning, a subfield of ML in which multiple objectives are trained within the same model at the same time.

                    <span>Today, we are excited to announce the integration of AppDynamics in the Azure Spring Cloud for full stack observability.

Over the past 20 months, we worked with many enterprise customers to learn about the scenarios they face. Many of these customers have thousands of Spring Boot applications running in on-premises data centers. As they migrate these applications to the cloud, they need to instrument them for application performance monitoring (APM) using solutions their developers are familiar with and have been using for years. In addition, they must ensure continuity for desktop and mobile applications that are already pre-instrumented for end-to-end monitoring using agents like AppDynamics, which automatically discovers and maps all applications, microservices, and infrastructure as …</span>

Over the last several years, progress has been made on privacy-safe approaches for handling sensitive data, for example, while discovering insights into human mobility and through use of federated analytics such as RAPPOR. In 2019, we released an open source library to enable developers and organizations to use techniques that provide differential privacy, a strong and widely accepted mathematical notion of privacy. Differentially-private data analysis is a principled approach that enables organizations to learn and release insights from the bulk of their data while simultaneously providing a mathematical guarantee that those results do not allow any individual user&#x27;s data to be …</span>

Hundreds of millions of people use spreadsheets, and formulas in those spreadsheets allow users to perform sophisticated analyses and transformations on their data. Although formula languages are simpler than general-purpose programming languages, writing these formulas can still be tedious and error-prone, especially for end-users. We&#x27;ve previously developed tools to understand patterns in spreadsheet data to automatically fill missing values in a column, but they were not built to support the process of writing formulas. 
In &quot;SpreadsheetCoder: Formula Prediction from Semi-structured Context&quot;, published at ICML 2021, we describe a new model that learns to automatically generate formulas based on t…</span>

Machine learning (ML) models are being used more widely today than ever before and are becoming increasingly impactful. However, they often exhibit unexpected behavior when they are used in real-world domains. For example, computer vision models can exhibit surprising sensitivity to irrelevant features, while natural language processing models can depend unpredictably on demographic correlations not directly indicated by the text. Some reasons for these failures are well-known: for example, training ML models on poorly curated data, or training models to solve prediction problems that are structurally mismatched with the application domain. Yet, even when these known problems are handled, model behavior can …</span>

Vision-language modeling grounds language understanding in corresponding visual inputs, which can be useful for the development of important products and tools. For example, an image captioning model generates natural language descriptions based on its understanding of a given image. While there are various challenges to such cross-modal work, significant progress has been made in the past few years on vision-language modeling thanks to the adoption of effective vision-language pre-training (VLP). This approach aims to learn a single feature space from both visual and language inputs, rather than learning two separate feature spaces, one each for visual inputs and another for language in…</span>

Machine learning (ML) is increasingly being used in real-world applications, so understanding the uncertainty and robustness of a model is necessary to ensure performance in practice. For example, how do models behave when deployed on data that differs from the data on which they were trained? How do models signal when they are likely to make a mistake? 
To get a handle on an ML model&#x27;s behavior, its performance is often measured against a baseline for the task of interest. With each baseline, researchers must try to reproduce results only using descriptions from the corresponding papers , which results in serious challenges for replication.

Over the past 20 months, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on daily life, presented logistical challenges for businesses planning for supply and demand, and created difficulties for governments and organizations working to support communities with timely public health responses. While there have been well-studied epidemiology models that can help predict COVID-19 cases and deaths to help with these challenges, this pandemic has generated an unprecedented amount of real-time publicly-available data, which makes it possible to use more advanced machine learning techniques in order to improve results.

In recent years, there has been increasing interest in applying deep learning to medical imaging tasks, with exciting progress in various applications like radiology, pathology and dermatology. Despite the interest, it remains challenging to develop medical imaging models, because high-quality labeled data is often scarce due to the time-consuming effort needed to annotate medical images. Given this, transfer learning is a popular paradigm for building medical imaging models. With this approach, a model is first pre-trained using supervised learning on a large labeled dataset (like ImageNet) and then the learned generic representation is fine-tuned on in-domain medical data.
