                    <span>Less than 70 years separate us from one of the greatest discoveries of all time: the double helix structure of DNA. We now know that DNA is a sort of a twisted ladder composed of four types of compounds, called bases. These four bases are usually identified by an uppercase letter: adenine (A), guanine (G), […]</span>

                    <span>Today we’re excited to announce the latest development in our ongoing partnership with Google Cloud. Now developers, site reliability engineers (SREs), and security analysts can ingest data from Google Pub/Sub to the Elastic Stack with just a few clicks in the Google Cloud Console. By leveraging Google Dataflow templates, Elastic makes it easy to stream events and logs from Google Cloud services like Google Cloud Audit, VPC Flow, or firewall into the Elastic Stack. This allows customers to simplify their data pipeline architecture, eliminate operational overhead, and reduce the time required for troubleshooting.

Many developers, SREs, and security analysts who use Google Cloud to develop applications and set up their infrastructure also use the Elastic Stack to troubleshoot, monitor, and …</span>

Malicious behavior protection applies behavior analytics to prevent attack techniques often leveraged by named threats by performing dynamic, stateful correlation of on-host events, and then reacting instantly to disrupt attacks before they cause damage.
Memory threat protection now safeguards Windows hosts, stopping attacks designed to evade most other defenses.
To accelerate response and prevent damage and loss, 7.15 adds host isolation for cloud-native Linux systems, making the capability now available on every OS protected by Elastic Agent.

We recommend that you keep it an arm&#x27;s length from production. There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-alpha2 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).
Also, 8.0.0-alpha2 will again not be available on Elastic Cloud. But, we expect to make a preview version available in the coming months, so you can also help us test on Cloud before heading for a production-ready release.

Employees at Elastic have come together to extend the US Hispanic Heritage Month to communities around the world of Hispanic and Latinx identities through a series of virtual learning and sharing–from ceviche and tortilla making to folklore and history-telling, from music showcases to cocktail mixings. 

To kick off the Sept 15th to Oct 15th festivities, we spoke with five Elasticians about what this month means to them and how they bring their heritage to work.

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! It’s September 14th! I can’t believe it. I know this is a common refrain on my weekly posts, but can you believe it’s already nearly Fall and Winter? What is happening?? How’d we get here so quickly? 

Anyway, how are you doin’? I’m doing alright! It’s been kinda a crazy week. I was in the studio all day and some of the night yesterday filming a new Livelessons video that I can’t wait for y’all to see. (But be forewarned: there will be .YAML!) 

Then, at 3am my time, I did a presentation for the Japanese Java User Group. This would be one thing in of itself, but what made this special for me was that I was supposed to appear at the JJUG six weeks ago. Yes, that six weeks ago. The same six weeks ago when I was convalescing with COVID-19, six weeks ago. Needless to say (bu…</span>

                    <span>It has been a while since Spring Framework 5.3 was released.
One of the features in that release was a major overhaul of our Reactive Multipart support.
In this blog post, we share some of the knowledge learned while working on this feature.
Specifically, we focus on finding a token within a stream of byte buffers.



Multipart Form Data



Whenever you upload a file, your browser sends it — and other fields in the form — to the server as a multipart/form-data message.
The exact format of these messages is described in RFC 7578.
If you submit a simple form with a single text field called foo and a file selector called file, the multipart/form-data message looks something like this:




POST / HTTP/1.1
Host: example.com
Content-Type: multipart/form-data;boundary&#x3D;&quot;boundary&quot; …</span>

He has spent the last 15 years helping companies advance their software delivery capabilities while maintaining reliability, working extensively to support customers in the SaaS, AI, and Service Management landscapes.

Meeting the goal of delivering great performance and reliability in the face of our ever-changing, increasingly autonomous IT environments is fundamentally challenged by a data problem. Sure, there’s lots of it - logs, metrics, and APM traces - but it is exceedingly hard to extract actionable information when there are so many fast moving parts.

                    <span>We are pleased to announce the general availability of the Google Cloud Private Service Connect integration with Elastic Cloud. Elastic Cloud VPC connectivity is now available to all customers across all subscription tiers and cloud providers (AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud).
Private Service Connect allows you to create private and secure connections from your clients running in your Google Cloud environments to your Elastic Cloud deployment endpoints running on Google Cloud. Private Service Connect provides service endpoints in your virtual private cloud (VPC) that provide private connectivity and policy enforcement, allowing you to easily connect to services like Elastic Cloud. All the traffic remains within the Google network, and it’s easy to set up and scale.
