                    <span>The term “boilerplate code” refers to code sections that are repeated across many projects with little to no variation. Every developer is familiar with boilerplate code, whether it be pom.xml files in Java or setting up React.js applications, tweaking boilerplate code for every project is inevitable. Actually, the company Wasp believes writing boilerplate code doesn’t

                    <span>Software engineers cite constant distractions, long commute times, and a lack of flexibility as the biggest challenges of working in an office setting, according to an internal employee survey conducted by the Elastic Culture team. But the survey also revealed that the biggest benefits of a distributed environment could be the new opportunities it opens for employees — for example, the freedom to catch some waves during the workday.

As Elastic offices slowly begin to reopen worldwide in accordance with local guidelines, we asked our Engineering and Product teams why they value being able to work for a company that’s distributed by intention — whether they work in an office, a shared workspace, or from home.

It is made possible by the general availability of Elastic Agent, which helps equip it to prevent, detect, and respond to threats before adversaries can steal sensitive information or sabotage operations. Let’s dig into the best of what it brings.
Quickly quarantine and inspect endpoints
Elastic Security 7.14 accelerates response by enabling analysts to invoke response actions with Elastic Agent. With the first native response action for Elastic Agent, host isolation, analysts can address malicious activity by quarantining a host from a network, containing the attack and preventing lateral movement to other hosts.

Security vendors are using the term “XDR” with increasing frequency, applying varied definitions to suit their respective technologies. The term began as an evolution of EDR (endpoint detection and response), and tried to encapsulate the need for varied data sources in the investigative process by using “X” for “eXtended.” Through all the varying definitions, the core concepts remain:

Elasticsearch is attractive for log analysis thanks to its ability to index log messages. Want to count how many log messages contain access denied in the last 24 hours? Elasticsearch can give you the answer in milliseconds thanks to its index structures — but index structures take CPU time to build and need disk space. You could save this CPU and disk space by not indexing your message fields, but then you would also lose the ability to query your logging data in an interactive way.

In order to reduce disk space requirements, match_only_text only indexes a subset of the information…</span>

A unified agent will simplify data onboarding with fewer things to configure and install.

Second, we are launching the GA release of Fleet, a new Kibana app that lets you centrally manage an entire fleet of Elastic Agents at scale. It acts as a control plane, giving you a real-time view into agent status, remotely upgrade agents, execute queries on each host, and contain security threats.

                    <span>As we’ve shown in a previous blog, search-based detection rules and Elastic’s machine learning-based anomaly detection can be a powerful way to identify rare and unusual activity in cloud API logs. Now, as of Elastic Security 7.13, we’ve introduced a new set of unsupervised machine learning jobs for network data, and accompanying alert rules, several of which look for geographic anomalies. In this blog post, we’ll explore a case study demonstrating how network data can yield important detections. 

Before the advent of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security teams relied heavily on network instrumentation like firewall logs and intrusion detection (IDS) alerts.

                    <span>Hiya! Our Elasticsearch team is continually improving our index Lifecycle Management (ILM) feature. When I first joined Elastic Support, I quickly got up to speed via our Automate rollover with ILM tutorial. I noticed after helping multiple users set up ILM that escalations mainly emerge from a handful of configuration issues. 

In the following sections, I’d like to cover frequent tickets, diagnostic flow, and common error recoveries. All commands shown can be run via Kibana’s Dev Tools.

The ILM backend process runs by default but requires user configuration to affect indices. You can verify ILM is running via ILM status returning operation_mode:RUNNING.

                    <span>One of Rain Hu&#x27;s favorite moments of the day is her early morning run. &quot;I run six kilometers minimum daily, rain or shine,&quot; she says. &quot;I enjoy the time alone because it allows me to have time for self-reflection and self-conversation.&quot;

The discipline that it takes to maintain a healthy lifestyle is carried throughout her life. As a wife, mother of two young boys, and sales leader, Rain optimizes her time so that she can show up fully and authentically in all aspects of her life.

We sat down with Rain, Regional Vice President of Sales (ASEAN and Hong Kong) at Elastic, to learn how she has built a career she loves. Read on to learn about how she grew her career in tech sales and what advice she has for others looking to do the same.

                    <span>In my previous blog post, I demonstrated how to use Prometheus and Fluentd with the Elastic Stack to monitor Kubernetes. That’s a good option if you’re already using those open source-based monitoring tools in your organization. But, if you’re new to Kubernetes monitoring, or want to take full advantage of Elastic Observability, there is an easier and more comprehensive way. In this blog, we will explore how to monitor Kubernetes the Elastic way: using Filebeat and Metricbeat.
Using Filebeat and Metricbeat
Beats, as you know, is a free and open platform dedicated to data shipping. Using Beats, you can transfer data from hundreds or thousands of machines to Logstash or Elasticsearch.
Filebeat, which is known as a lightweight log shipper, also supports containerized architecture. Filebeat ca…</span>

                    <span>DevOps has shortened the development life cycle for countless applications and is embraced by companies around the world. But managing and monitoring multiple environments is still a major pain point, particularly when companies need to mix cloud and legacy systems. Knowing when services go down and quickly pinpointing the cause is essential for continuous development.

                    <span>TL;DR - head over to spring.io/survey to take the State of Spring 2021 survey! You can also RT this tweet and help spread the word! Thank you &lt;3


We ran the State of Spring survey last year, and it was a huge success. Spring community members across the globe, like you, shared their views and experiences, and it all made for fantastic reading.

The survey is back this year, and we want to hear from you! How can Spring help you build new apps and experiences this year? What would you like us to change? This year, we have new sections on Spring Native, building &amp; sharing APIs internally/externally, and a deeper dive on Data.

In exchange for 15 minutes of your time taking the survey, you’ll be among the first to receive our report and the insights included in it. 

Sounds good? Head over to spring.io/survey now! The survey will close at the end of July. 

Do consider helping us share the survey by retweeting this post on Spring Central twitter, and thank you for sharing your thoughts and experiences with us!
