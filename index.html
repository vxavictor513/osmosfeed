                    <span>When working with Cloud Native applications on top of Kubernetes, you might need to make some hard decisions about where to run the services and infrastructure that your applications need, which will directly impact your maintenance costs. Figuring out how to consume a remote service, or if you can host the service inside your Kubernetes Clusters, is key to estimating how many resources you will need.  Process Automation tools have been traditionally installed and maintained inside the organization. This means everyone involved, from developers to operations teams, understand the requirements and how to efficiently run these tools.  With the rise of Cloud Services, having a fully fledged Process Automation suite in the Cloud is now possible. But what are the...

compile &quot;org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-aws:2.5.0&quot;




Mostly this version is a major move from Spring Cloud for AWS project hosted on Spring Cloud side to its own organization.
Plus it includes upgrades to the latest dependencies, including recently released Spring Integration 5.5.



Many thanks to everyone from the Community for all the feedback and contribution to this project.

                    <span>Greetings Spring community,



The Spring Web Services team has released 3.1.1. This is the first major release under the new versioning schema. Releases will no longer have .RELEASE and snapshots will only be -SNAPSHOT, to better comply with community approaches.



While we strive to maintain alignment with Spring Framework and Spring Security, we also test against Java 8, Java 11, and Java LATEST (JDK 16 as of today).



For more details, read the following release notes for each version:



Release Notes - Spring Web Services - Version 3.1.1.





#1198 - Test against JDK 16 on CI.



#1197 - Upgrade to Spring Framework 5.3.7.



#1187 - Upgrade to Spring Security 5.5.0.



#1199 - Don’t skip main build targets during releases.

                    <span>We all want to work for a company where we fit in. That’s why Elastic built a Source Code that encourages all to come as they are. In the Someone Like Me blog series, we highlight Elasticians who have a unique story — one, perhaps, just as unique as yours.

In this edition we revisit Bill McConaghy, senior manager of software engineering on Kibana, to talk about his experience with Elastic’s Accessibility Working Group, an employee resource and equity-seeking team that works to create and develop a disability inclusive workplace at Elastic.

Last year we talked to you about the recently formed Accessibility Working Group, and the work they were planning to make Elastic more accessible. What has the group been able to accomplish?

                    <span>Camunda Platform Run, or Camunda Run for short, is a lightweight distribution of Camunda Platform that works straight out-of-the-box and comes pre-configured for production environments. Camunda Run is an excellent option if you’re just getting started with Camunda, or if you’re ready to use Camunda Platform in production. You can download the open-source Community Edition for free, and easily upgrade to the Enterprise Edition to access more features and support options. After you download and extract Camunda Run, you’ll find a configuration folder that contains a file called production.yml. The properties defined in this file are important for production environments and are derived from our guide to securing your Camunda Platform installation. To start Camunda Run with the production.yml configuration,...

On behalf of the team and all the contributors, it’s my pleasure to announce a General Availability for Spring Integration 5.5, plus Spring Integration 5.4.7 patch release.



Both versions can be obtained from Maven Central and it is recommended to upgrade your projects or just pull them transitively from respective latest Spring Boot patch versions!

Spring Integration 5.4.7 version contains mostly critical bug fixes and here is a highlight of notable changes made to Spring Integration 5.5, which, in general, is based on the community feedback to make the framework useful for end-user use-cases:

                    <span>It has been just over two years since we introduced the Elastic Common Schema (ECS), and what a journey it’s been. From categorization fields to request for comments to Threat Intelligence fields, ECS has evolved rapidly over the course of the last two years. In this blog post, I would like to reflect on the ECS journey so far, and look towards the future of ECS. 
 You may by now be well experienced with ECS as a specification that provides a consistent and customizable way to structure your data in Elasticsearch, facilitating the analysis of data from diverse sources. With ECS, analytics content such as dashboards and machine learning jobs can be applied more broadly, searches can be crafted more narrowly, and field names are easier to remember.

It’s a chance for me to understand more about what people across the Azure organization do and how they do it. Every week we get together at 11 AM Pacific on Microsoft LearnTV and learn more about Azure.

                    <span>When it comes to malware attacks, one of the more common techniques is “living off the land” (LOtL). Utilizing standard tools or features that already exist in the target environment allows these attacks to blend into the environment and avoid detection. While these techniques can appear normal in isolation, they start looking suspicious when observed in the parent-child context. This is where the ProblemChild framework can help. 

In this blog, we will talk about how you can use Elastic machine learning to create your own ProblemChild framework to detect LOtL activity in Windows process event data (we will be referring to Windows process events as just “events” throughout this blog). We will talk in detail about the following:

                    <span>Red Hat Ansible Engine v2.9 introduced the first set of Resource Modules that make network automation easier and more consistent, especially in multi-vendor environments. These network resource specific and opinionated Ansible modules help us avoid creating overly complex Jinja2 templates to render and push network configurations, thereby easing the adoption of network automation both in green and brownfield environments. The resource modules, along with the tools provided in ansible.utils, are highly focused on allowing the end user to manipulate network configuration as “structured data” and not have to worry about network platform specific details.</span>

“Sometimes people teased her about her accent, but she was always so proud. She didn’t care. Her accent was her own. I have always looked for places that allow me to have my own accent as well. It hasn’t always been easy,” said Nikko.
He began his career in IT when he got a job in retail at an Apple store to support himself while pursuing a degree in child and adolescent development. Eventually, he was promoted to an internal corporate tech support role. As his mom taught him, he kept focusing on how his experiences could help him stand out and achieve more.…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! First: a happy belated mother’s day to you! Being a mom is already the hardest job, and it got considerably harder this last year as a global pandemic descended on the world forcing so many new complications on an already fraught enterprise: raising a family. So, thank you, moms. (Also: you deserve far more than just a day!)

                    <span>At Camunda, we have always pushed ourselves to innovate in the field of Process Automation. From our early days as a lightweight Java project, we’ve relentlessly innovated — engineering an end-to-end Process Automation tech stack that has helped organizations across the globe automate mission-critical processes. But innovation never stops and organizations continue to look for new ways to increase the velocity of business transformation. To address this need, more and more organizations are turning to the cloud, which is increasingly becoming a business transformation accelerator.  That being said, as enterprise applications are being built entirely in the cloud, organizations are struggling with automating processes across multiple systems, people, and devices in an end-to-end manner. These processes often include modern components...

We have continually developed additional resource modules to make automating network appliances easier, and more approachable, for novices and experts alike. These resource modules provide a consistent experience across multiple network vendors. There are seven main state parameters for resource modules: merged, replaced, overridden, deleted, gathered, rendered and parsed. The Ansible network team is adding one more parameter, purged, to this tool chest for resource modules.

                    <span>Elastic&#x27;s new frozen data tier decouples compute from storage and leverages low-cost object stores such as Google Cloud Storage, Azure Blob Storage, or Amazon S3 to directly power searches. It provides unlimited scaling of storage while preserving the ability to efficiently query the data without any need to rehydrate it first, making it easier and cheaper to manage data at scale.

In this blog post we compare search performance on the new frozen tier with the existing Elasticsearch data tiers, and we show how with the frozen tier you can store and search far larger amounts of data at lower performance. The main highlights of the frozen tier are:

“When I was a kid my mom used to make dumplings for my packed lunch,” says Kathy. “Other kids would make fun of it. At the time I was embarrassed, but now I appreciate how much effort she put into giving me those tastes of my heritage.”

What is APM?
Application performance monitoring lets you see where your applications spend their time, what they are doing, what other applications or services they are calling, and what errors or exceptions they are encountering.



In addition, APM also lets you see history and trends for key performance indicators, such as latency and throughput, as well as transaction and dependency information:

WEF and WEC
 
Modern versions of Windows include the Windows Remote Management (WinRM) services that implement the WS-Management (WSman) protocol, and just to add to the acronym spaghetti soup, this is all part of Windows Management Instrumentation (WMI). One component of WinRM is the Windows Event Forwarding (WEF) service, this is why WinRM and co. need to be enabled.

Tom Wilde, inside cloud account executive

After about two years as a user success manager, I began to master the art of outbound sales — cold calling potential enterprise customers, working to find new leads via LinkedIn, and having proof-of-concept conversations. But I was eager for the chance to learn how to make sales from inbound leads. My manager encouraged me to apply for an opening on the inside cloud account team and a more senior role.

Did you get an alert that heap usage is spiking on a specific server? A quick search of the logs filtered from that host shows that cache misses started around the same time as the initial spike. Digging into the metadata (date and version) of the highlighted logs from that time period show us that this was likely due to a recent code push. As seen here —  and in many other cases — logs hold the clues to what was happening during, before, or after an issue, which can help identify where to focus our attention next.

                    <span>Modern applications are increasingly built as large, distributed systems. A distributed system is a program where its components are located on different machines that communicate with one another to create a single cohesive app. Components may exist as multiple instances across “nodes,” the computers hosting them, which form clusters of nodes that span across geographic

                    <span>Hiya! With Elastic’s expansion of our Elasticsearch Service Cloud offering and automated onboarding, we’ve expanded the Elastic Stack audience from full ops teams to data engineers, security teams, and consultants. As an Elastic support rep, I’ve enjoyed interacting with more user backgrounds and with even wider use cases. 

With a wider audience, I’m seeing more questions about managing resource allocation, in particular the mystical shard-heap ratio and avoiding circuit breakers. I get it! When I started with the Elastic Stack, I had the same questions. It was my first intro to managing Java heap and time series database shards, and scaling my own infrastructure.

When I joined the Elastic team, I loved that on top of documentation, we had blogs and tutorials so I could onboard quickly. …</span>

We officially started our collaboration and strategic partnership with Alibaba Cloud back in 2017, when we announced the Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch service. Since then, we’ve seen rapid adoption and growth of the service, which now supports more than 10 petabytes of data. This year, we’ve recognized Alibaba Cloud as our Ecosystem Partner of the Year to acknowledge their contributions in advocating for free and open technology and developing value for our joint customers over the past three years.

A reason for the rapid growth of Alibaba Cloud Elasticsearch is down to Alibaba Cloud’s proactive push to drive the adoption of Elasticsearch and their approach to educating developers and enterprises on how to optimize their use of El…</span>
