                      <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another installment of This Week in Spring! How&rsquo;re you doing? I hope you&rsquo;re doing well, and that the Fourth (of May) is with you. 

Today may be the 4th, but yesterday was the third of May, and that marks the 20th anniversary of the JdbcTemplate, which I think is super cool! Happy birthday, JdbcTemplate! The JdbcTemplate was important to a lot of people because it&rsquo;s one of those great little utilities that made it easy to justify pulling Spring into application…</span>

                      <span>When the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Technology Radar team started work on its latest edition focusing on secrets management, they “expected the results to overwhelmingly show that organizations are using the offering of the public cloud they are already using,” recalled Steve Nolen, a site reliability engineer (SRE) at RStudio and a Radar team member, in the CNCF Radar report. But the survey results upended that expectation.

                      <span>Encryption algorithms provide the means to secure and transfer sensitive information by taking input and transforming it into an unreadable output. Usually a special key, or multiple keys, are needed to unscramble the information back to the original input. These algorithms power the security of everything from our cell phone lock screens to Fortune 500

 Instead, it has evolved to support new use cases and to secure us a managed security service provider partnership (MSSP) with Elastic so that we can help our own customers experience the same digital transformation success we’ve realized along the way.

                      <span>A liquid market enables individuals or groups to quickly buy and sell assets. Decentralized platforms can struggle to execute trades when their platform does not have much liquidity for a specific token. Newer tokens or tokens with limited supply are most often the least liquid because there might be an imbalance of buyers and sellers.
