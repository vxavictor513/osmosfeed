Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil‚Ä¶</span>

Overview
Following the discovery of Log4Shell, a vulnerability in Log4J2, Elastic released a blog post describing how users of our platform can leverage Elastic Security to help defend their networks. We also released an advisory detailing how Elastic products and users are impacted.
In this blog, we expand on these initial posts and highlight how the combination of security and observability solutions can provide deep visibility into the exploited vulnerability and arm security analysts with valuable data for root cause analysis.
Gaining the upper hand - combining Observability and Security data
Along with Elastic Security, we provide a comprehensive Observability suite within Kibana. Observability is primarily referring to the combination of application performance monitoring (APM), lo‚Ä¶</span>

As the years of my Elastic journey progressed, kindness, empathy and understanding for all employees has permeated the culture via emails, corporate policies and conversations.

The early stages of an intrusion usually include initial access, execution, persistence, and command-and-control (C2) beaconing. When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected. It can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary as we saw in the 2020 SUNBURST supply chain compromise. Could we then have detected SUNBURST in the initial hours or days by finding its C2 beacon?
The potential for beaconing detection is that it can serve as an early warning system and help discover novel persistence mechanisms in the initial hours or days after execution. This allows defenders to disrupt or evict the threat actor before they can achieve their objectives. So, while we are not quite &quot;left of boom&quot; b‚Ä¶</span>

Today we had an exciting announcement at Elastic. Below is part of an internal email that we shared with our fellow Elasticians. 
First, hear from Shay:
Almost two years ago, I decided to move to Israel because it was better for my family (that took time to happen, Covid!). At that time, I started thinking about how to do what is right for my family while being able to be a meaningful part of Elastic. Those of you who know me, know that Elastic is my life‚Äôs work. And we have only just begun. Our potential is massive. And I plan to be a part of it for a very, very long time. 
At around that time, the Elastic Board and I brought in several new leaders. We had time to closely observe our leaders in action. We want to make sure we have the right team, in the right roles - to realize our pote‚Ä¶</span>

We are thrilled to announce the first release candidate of 8.0.0 after the last beta release. Again, we want to remind you that this is not for production use. There is no guarantee that 8.0.0-rc1 will be compatible with other preview releases or with 8.0.0 general availability (GA).
We‚Äôd love to get your feedback and tips on any bugs you find through our Pioneer Program. To become an Elastic Pioneer, try out the preview of any (preferably, every) part of the Elastic Stack and open issues as you find them in the appropriate repo ‚Äî Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, Logstash, and APM. When you open an issue, mention that you found the bug in 8.0.0-rc1, and we‚Äôll add a ‚ÄúPioneer Program‚Äù label.
If you have questions about preparing for your upgrade to 8.0, visit our forums or community Slack channel, and we‚Äôd be happy to help!

Try it out
And now, without further ado, we bring to you 8.0.0-rc1. Happy downloading. Go forth, and explore.

Over the last several decades, I&#x27;ve witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we&#x27;ll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I‚Äôll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I‚Äôll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we‚Äôll likely see in the next few years.

As we kick off a new year, so does new and refreshed thinking in the public sector. With another full year of lessons learned from the pandemic, public sector leaders will apply these insights in the way they execute their documented data strategies. 
Synthesizing what we see and hear from our stakeholders, below are five of the needle movers we see in public sector data strategy execution. Note that the key here is data, and being deliberate with it: 2022 will be the year of harnessing the power of data.

Overview
With our recent 7.16 Elastic Security product release, we improved our existing¬†Linux malware feature by adding memory protection. In this blog, brought to you by Elastic‚Äôs Engineering Security Team, we lean into this recent advancement to show how we are protecting the world‚Äôs data from attack.
Recent events such as the exploitation of the Open Management Infrastructure (OMI) agent through CVE-2021-38647, which is installed by many Azure Linux machines, represents how quickly adversaries are moving from a publicly released proof-of-concept (POC) to exploitation. Another similar case with a recent VMware vCenter Server vulnerability (CVE-2021-22005) showed the same pattern where within hours of the security disclosure, malicious actors started mass scanning infrastructure target‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>Happy New Year, Spring community!



Hope you had great holidays and ready for new excitements in front of us.



After the rest and recharging during Christmas break I decided to pay honor to my favorite language back in days - Groovy.



And now it‚Äôs my pleasure to present you a brand new Groovy DSL for Spring Integration.
You perhaps heard about our old attempt to make a Groovy DSL on top of Spring Integration XML support.
But the solution was pretty cumbersome (especially for protocol-specific channel adapters) and support burden has grown tremendously.
This my latest implementation is fully based on already mature Java DSL and its builder pattern support.



Having 10 years experience with Gradle I thought that it is going be easy enough for me to prepare quickly someth‚Ä¶</span>

As the Spring Boot releases 2.6.2 and 2.5.8 picking up these Spring Framework versions were due the day before Christmas and given the medium severity, we postponed the announcement until after the new year, to avoid disclosure during a period when many take time off.

Government data strategies lay a promising groundwork for how data will be used to drive more informed decision making internally and more streamlined public services externally. A commonality between these strategies is the need for improved role-based data sharing and data re-use. The sticking point, however, is in the way to implement data sharing when there are known silos across and within various departments. More often than not, these silos exist for good reason, particularly for data privacy compliance requirements.
How can these hurdles be overcome and the promise of data sharing across government departments be realized?

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Happy new year! I can‚Äôt believe we quickly got this far, but we did. This last year‚Äôs been insanely busy, and one of the things I‚Äôve most loved is all the opportunities to use Spring Native to build GraalVM-powered architecture-specific native images.

We released Spring Native 0.11, which is fantastic because it features a brand new AOT (ahead-of-time) engine that completely reworks how we transpile Spring Boot applications into GraalVM native images. I‚Äôve been working with GraalVM a lot over the last two years, and this new release is a vast, revolutionary step in the story of Spring Native and a giant leap forward on the journey to Spring Framework 6 and Spring Boot 3, both of which will land in 2022.

Later today, the girls and I will drive home to San Francisco, California. I‚Äôve enjoyed my visits with people here in Los Angeles, especially since it‚Äôs our first actual visit to Los Angeles before the pandemic. 

And now, (can you believe it?), we‚Äôre staring down the new year. As always, I will do my yearly This Year in Spring roundup, so stay tuned for that below, after our weekly roundup. So, without further ado, here‚Äôs the last This Week in Spring recap of 2021.

On behalf of the team and all the contributors, it‚Äôs my pleasure to wish you a Merry Christmas and Happy New Year and present you a fresh Spring Integration 5.5.7 release.



It can be obtained from Maven Central and it is recommended to upgrade your projects or just pull it transitively from respective latest Spring Boot patch version!

The notable changes and important bug fixes are:

It is likely in the next major 6.0 version we will rename it to GROUP_CONDITION.
So, it is recommended to upgrade to this 5.5.7 version if you deal with Jdbc‚Ä¶</span>

Federated learning enables users to train a model without sending raw data to a central server, thus avoiding the collection of privacy-sensitive data. Often this is done by learning a single global model for all users, even though the users may differ in their data distributions. For example, users of a mobile keyboard application may collaborate to train a suggestion model but have different preferences for the suggestions. This heterogeneity has motivated algorithms that can personalize a global model for each user.  
 However, in some settings privacy considerations may prohibit learning a fully global model. Consider models with user-specific embeddings, such as matrix factorization models for recommender systems. Tr‚Ä¶</span>

                    <span>A financial customer explained his first automation priority in the most visual and understandable way: ‚ÄúI want to paint all of my network devices with the color of the company.‚Äù What I like about that analogy is that it clearly describes the first rule for automation: customers must define their golden configurations (the color to paint) to be able to automate configurations and later assess compliance, and remediate any issues accordingly.¬†
A ‚Äúgolden configuration‚Äù usually refers to a Day 1 configuration, and covers the minimal settings needed for a network device to be configured after a fresh network operating system installation. This usually includes common services such as NTP, DNS, AAA, Syslog, SNMP, and ACLs for management connectivity.</span>

For a machine learning (ML) algorithm to be effective, useful features must be extracted from (often) large amounts of training data. However, this process can be made challenging due to the costs associated with training on such large datasets, both in terms of compute requirements and wall clock time. The idea of distillation plays an important role in these situations by reducing the resources required for the model to be effective. The most widely known form of distillation is model distillation (a.k.a. knowledge distillation), where the predictions of large, complex teacher models are distilled into smaller models.  
 An alternative option to this model-space approach is dataset ‚Ä¶</span>
