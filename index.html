                    <span>Kibana creates easy ways to do powerful things with all of your data — to ask and answer questions and follow the flow of analysis. Many times the answer to your question requires calculations based on queried data. Formulas allow you to author your own metrics by combining multiple aggregated fields using math operations.

In addition, moving through and replaying your data in time and space are powerful ways to gain historical context and understand additional insight about the present.

In the below sections you’ll find 10 examples of questions you can answer with dashboard data and map visualizations in Kibana via formulas, time shifts, and moving through data in time. Try following along with your own data or using Kibana’s sample datasets. Have a question? Head on over to our discuss…</span>

N2 VMs leverage Intel 2nd Generation Xeon Scalable processors and provide a balance of compute, memory, and storage. N2 machine types also offer more than a 20% improvement in price-performance over the first-generation N1 machines.



When you provision an Elastic deployment on Google Cloud you will automatically leverage N2 VM types. You can select the default configuration, or choose one of four custom configurations. This optionality allows you to select a combination of vCPU, RAM, and storage to deliver optimal performance for your specific use case. For example, you may select a configurat…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doing? I’m alright. I’ve been recuperating from a COVID-19 infection. Today was the first day in a while that I woke up and wasn’t short of breath. Most days, I’ve woken up, hacked a few wads of phlegm into the toilet, and then my breathing was fine. But today I woke up and wasn’t short of breath in the first place. (I still hacked a few wads of phlegm). Thank goodness for vaccines, or I expect my experience of this virus would’ve been much worse as a lifelong asthmatic. Things are looking up! 

And then, as if my fortunes couldn’t get any better, I got to compiling this week’s roundup and there’s a ton of great stuff in it so let’s dive right in!

                    <span>We are very excited to announce that Spring Authorization Server has officially moved out of experimental status and into the Spring project’s portfolio!



This move coincides with this week’s 0.2.0 release, which is the first officially supported production-ready version backed by our new support policy.



Since announcing the Spring Authorization Server in April 2020, the implemented features provide support for a large portion of the OAuth 2.1 Authorization Framework and modest support for OpenID Connect 1.0. However, as we move onto the next phase of development, our focus changes to advancing the support for OpenID Connect 1.0.



On behalf of the team, I would like to thank everyone who has contributed and helped grow this project in this short time frame. We are confident in the base that we have built so far and are excited for the next phase of the project. We look forward to continuing this work together and ultimately making Spring Authorization Server the de facto framework for OAuth 2 Authorization Server support on the Java platform.



Let’s get moving onto the next phase!</span>

An application running in production is a difficult beast to tame.

Most experienced developers–ones who spent enough late nights or Saturday mornings trying to break apart a nasty production bug–will try and create the clearest possible picture for their later selves while writing their code, so that they could understand what’s actually going on in the system during an incident.

                    <span>With Elastic 7.14, the filestream input, the successor of log input, is now generally available in Filebeat. This new, superior input provides better support for reading active log files, with faster reaction time when there is backpressure in the system, quicker registry updates, better cooperation with external log rotation tools, and more. 
 
Improved registry performance
 
Previously, when a registry file (the file used for saving the progress of publishing events) contained many entries, state updates became slower, even if Filebeat was only collecting a few files. The main problem was that the complete registry was serialized after every ACK from the outputs. That required an expensive fsync call per registry write. Now offset updates are written to the file in an append-only manner.…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! How’re you doing? I hope you’re doing well. You know, I’ve been thinking a lot about how to retain that zen-like peace that comes with a vacation spent on the beach. I got back from Hawaii eight days ago and I found it to be so very beautiful. Nature really sold it for me; the fresh air is everything. If you don’t have ready access to nature - if you, like me, are in a giant city with the ongoing sound of car horns (“klaxons”), fire engines, traffic, and everything else that accompanies any big city - then may I invite you to breathe with me? 

Just sit still for 30 seconds. Focus on these words. Inhale. Take a big, deep breath, and then hold it in for a few seconds. Then exhale. When was the last time you did that? I don’t do that nearly enough. If I spend 30 or 60 secon…</span>

Also, 8.0.0-alpha1 will not be available on Elastic Cloud. But, we expect to make a preview version available in the coming months.

They’ve created communities of like-minded developers, generated new financial markets, and popularized “decentralization” in computer networks. However, they require large resources to operate which makes scaling difficult and transactions expensive. Hedera is a decentralized public network that takes the

And I am, for better or for worse, back from vacation! I am so happy to be back, but I do miss the sunkissed beaches of Hawai’i. Sigh. Anyway, let’s get into it!

Let’s dig into the best of what it brings.
Quickly quarantine and inspect endpoints
Elastic Security 7.14 accelerates response by enabling analysts to invoke response actions with Elastic Agent. With the first native response action for Elastic Agent, host isolation, analysts can address malicious activity by quarantining a host from a network, containing the attack and preventing lateral movement to other hosts.

Security vendors are using the term “XDR” with increasing frequency, applying varied definitions to suit their respective technologies. The term began as an evolution of EDR (endpoint detection and response), and tried to encapsulate the need for varied data sources in the investigative process by using “X” for “eXtended.” Through all the varying definitions, the core concepts remain:

Elasticsearch is attractive for log analysis thanks to its ability to index log messages. Want to count how many log messages contain access denied in the last 24 hours? Elasticsearch can give you the answer in milliseconds thanks to its index structures — but index structures take CPU time to build and need disk space. You could save this CPU and disk space by not indexing your message fields, but then you would also lose the ability to query your logging data in an interactive way.

In order to reduce disk space requirements, match_only_text only indexes a subset of the information…</span>

A unified agent will simplify data onboarding with fewer things to configure and install.

Second, we are launching the GA release of Fleet, a new Kibana app that lets you centrally manage an entire fleet of Elastic Agents at scale. It acts as a control plane, giving you a real-time view into agent status, remotely upgrade agents, execute queries on each host, and contain security threats.

                    <span>As we’ve shown in a previous blog, search-based detection rules and Elastic’s machine learning-based anomaly detection can be a powerful way to identify rare and unusual activity in cloud API logs. Now, as of Elastic Security 7.13, we’ve introduced a new set of unsupervised machine learning jobs for network data, and accompanying alert rules, several of which look for geographic anomalies. In this blog post, we’ll explore a case study demonstrating how network data can yield important detections. 

Before the advent of endpoint detection and response (EDR) tools, security teams relied heavily on network instrumentation like firewall logs and intrusion detection (IDS) alerts. Given the lack of process information or user context, in network logs, the false positive rate for network events c…</span>
