                    <span>TL;DR: We recommend that you use the new point-in-time functionality in Elasticsearch if you can. The scroll API is no longer recommended for deep pagination (even though it still works).
Most data is constantly changing. When querying an index in Elasticsearch, you are essentially searching for data at a given point of time. With an index that is constantly changing — as in most observability and security use cases — two identical queries performed at two different times will return different results because the data has changed over time. So, what do you do if you need to remove that time variable?
The point in time (PIT) reader, which was introduced in Elasticsearch 7.10, gives you the ability to repeatedly query an index as it was at a specific point in time.

Decisions that need to be made in an instant require answers in real time, but existing big data systems are unable to return queries quickly enough for real-time analytics. And with growing data being queried by more connected users than ever before, it’s getting increasingly challenging to maintain fast reaction times. 

The DoD Data Strategy approaches this challenge by providing a blueprint for how data should be managed and accessed by the services, ensuring that trusted information gets to the right destinations at the right time.

I put together an episode of Spring Tips, the most comprehensive of its kind, introducing (almost) everything you’ll need to know about Spring Native and Spring Native 0.10.0 in particular. Start here. Spring Native is awesome and this is the comprehensive introduction I wish I’d had at the start. 

The next time we meet in this humble column, next week, will be June 22nd, and by then we’ll have passed summer solstice - the longest day in the year! - and the beginning of summer. Farewell (for now) to Spring, the season, and long live Spring, the easiest and most productive path to production for your applications. 

Anyway, my friends, we’ve got a ton of things to look at this week, starting of course with that Spring Native video and release announcement, of course, so let’s get to it! 


  
In this week’s installment of Spring Tips, I look at Spring Native 0.10.0, available now.

                    <span>I hate reinventing the wheel once I find a good setup. On top of that, I dislike searching for all the links I used to come up with the “ultimate setup” for different services. So, I decided to outline for myself (and for you of course) my default setup when I deploy on Elastic Cloud to set myself up for success and automate insight for the future. Most of my setup steps make monitoring accessible or automate various warnings to myself.

By the end of this article you will have configured your cluster for full observability, which includes metric and log collection, troubleshooting views, and cluster alerts to automate performance monitoring.

                    <span>Security teams defending Windows environments often rely on anti-malware products as a first line of defense against malicious executables. Microsoft provides security vendors with the ability to register callbacks that will be invoked upon the creation of processes on the system. Driver developers can call APIs such as PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx to receive such events.

Despite the name, PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutineEx callbacks are not actually invoked upon the creation of processes, but rather upon the creation of the first threads within those processes. This creates a gap between when a process is created and when security products are notified of its creation. It also gives malware authors a window to tamper with the backing executable before security products can scan it. R…</span>

                    <span>Elastic Cloud on Kubernetes (ECK) is an easy way to get the Elastic Stack up and running on top of Kubernetes. That’s because ECK automates the deployment, provisioning, management, and setup of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Beats, and more. 

As logging and metric data — or time series data — has a predictable lifespan, you can use hot, warm, and cold architecture to easily manage your data over time as it ages and becomes less relevant.

In this guide, we’ll explain how to set up SAML with auth0 as an identity provider (IdP) as well as how to configure your deployment for hot-warm-cold architecture with ECK. We’ll use production features such as:

Dedicated nodes
Zone awareness
Pod and node affinity
PodDisruption
Dedicated storage class
Before you get started, you should be familiar with SAML. …</span>

It’s one of those weeks where, even though the thing I wanted to happen - a vacation with the family - didn’t happen, what did happen - accidentally lots of free time with no meetings - has turned out wonderfully. It was all I could do to pry myself from the IDE to pull together this week’s roundup, but I am glad I did! There’s a ton of great stuff there. Let’s dive into it.

If you want a headline as to why you should consider adopting Elastic for security and observability, that is it. 

We often work with our customers to help them establish the business value of Elastic within their organizations. We commissioned Forrester to conduct a Total Economic Impact (TEI) study of our security and observability solutions so our customers have an unbiased view that they can share with their internal stakeholders. The TEI examines the ROI organizations realize by deploying the Elastic Observability and Security solutions. 

This study showcases the incredible value that our customers are achieving and provides guidance to help you consider the costs, benefits, and business impact Elastic can bring to your organization.

                    <span>In an earlier blog post, we spoke about building your own ProblemChild framework from scratch in the Elastic Stack to detect living off the land (LOtL) activity. As promised, we have now also released a fully trained detection model, anomaly detection configurations, and detection rules that you can use to get ProblemChild up and running in your environment in a matter of minutes. 

This blog provides a high-level breakdown of the steps to enrich your Windows process event data using the released model to generate alerts when LOtL activity is detected in your environment. A more detailed documentation of the steps to be followed can be found in our publicly available detection-rules repository.

                    <span>This quick blog is the first in a two-part series discussing a userland Windows exploit initially disclosed by James Forshaw and Alex Ionescu. The exploit enables attackers to perform highly privileged actions that typically require a kernel driver.

Protected process light
Windows 8.1 introduced the concept of Protected Process Light (PPL), which enables specially-signed programs to run in such a way that they are immune from tampering and termination, even by administrative users. The goal is to keep malware from running amok — tampering with critical system processes and terminating anti-malware applications. There is a hierarchy of PPL “levels,” with higher-privilege ones immune from tampering by lower-privilege ones, but not vice-versa.

We asked Kiley Davidson, IT Systems Engineer, to talk about her experience and share how Elastic’s culture allowed her to come out at work and thrive as a trans woman.
 
How did you know that Elastic was a safe place for you when you joined in 2018?

When I joined Elastic in April of 2018, I knew I was trans, but wasn’t out to anyone but my wife and therapist. Even after starting my transition later that year, the idea of coming out at work was utterly terrifying: considering what often happens when transgender people transition at work…</span>

                    <span>Dear Spring Community,



Today it’s my pleasure to announce releases of Spring Integration for Amazon Web Services extension versions 2.5.1 and Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0.



These releases can be downloaded from Maven Central:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.integration:spring-integration-aws:2.5.1&#x27;




If you don’t use Kinesis Binder.
Or via Binder dependency:




compile &#x27;org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-stream-binder-kinesis:2.2.0&#x27;




Spring Integration for AWS extension of 2.5.1 has some minor bug fixes after the previous 2.5.0 announcement.



The Spring Cloud Stream Binder for AWS Kinesis 2.2.0 is the first release in the project generation which is based on a new independent Spring Cloud for AWS artifact. It also was upgraded to the latest Spring Cloud 2020.0.3 and has some other bug fixes and improvements.



Any feedback is welcome via all the available communication channels!

                    <span>Creating an entity-centric index that contains only the latest document for each entity can be useful in a number of situations. For example, maybe you&#x27;re managing an ecommerce site and you want to track the latest order placed by each of your customers. Or maybe you want to run a campaign targeting customers who haven&#x27;t been active over a certain period. What&#x27;s the fastest and most efficient way to compile and organize such data?

Transforms in Elasticsearch enable you to create and maintain an entity-centric index based on the event index and a transforming function. Until recently, the only possible function was pivot, which is a continuous group-by plus aggregations. In version 7.12, we’ve added one more transforming function, called latest. It transforms a source index into a destinat…</span>

As part of that change, we created Elastic License 2.0 (ELv2) as a permissive,  fair-code license, which allows free use, redistribution, modification, and derivative works, with only three simple limitations, outlined in our original announcement.  
  
 We&#x27;ve been happy to see the level of community support for this change.  While we would have preferred to collaborate with Amazon, we&#x27;re glad that with their fork and commitment to rename the Amazon Elasticsearch Service, it means that they will no longer be the cause of confusion in the Elasticsearch and Kibana commu…</span>

We need a way for a test to start a server and tell us where it is listening, and then we need to be able to register request and response examples (a.k.a. &quot;contracts&quot;). That’s what this project provides - it’s like Wiremock but for RSocket.



Getting Started



The easiest way to use the project is as a JUnit (Jupiter) extension, e.g:




@SpringBootTest
@ExtendWith(RSocketServerExtension.class)
class SocketsApplicationTests {
	...
}




With this extension installed the Spring Boot tests will run with an RSocket server listening on a port given by test.rsocket.server.port, so the test can connect directly to it, or (more likely) the code that it is testing will connect to it. …</span>

                    <span>In our last episode, I wrote about some speed improvements to date_histogram and I was beside myself with excitement to see if I could apply the same principles to other aggregations. I&#x27;ve spent most of the past few months playing a small part developing runtime fields but eventually I found time to take a look at the terms aggregation.
 
It&#x27;s time for terms!

With the date_histogram aggregation we got a huge performance boost by rewriting it as a filters aggregation internally. Rewriting terms as filters has more mixed results. I often saw a wonderful speed up (454ms -&gt; 131ms). Check the linked PR for more about &quot;often&quot;. But now that we&#x27;ve rewritten the agg as filters, we can do much better! 

We landed another optimization that I&#x27;m really excited about. It&#x27;s such a great shortcut it feel…</span>

The value Bhavya places on curiosity and diverse perspectives is a direct result of her experiences. Bhavya grew up in the South of India, in a province called Karnataka. She studied software engineering and worked in Bangalore before moving to Montreal with her partner.
