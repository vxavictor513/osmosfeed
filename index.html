                    <span>Posted by Abhijit Guha Roy, Research Software Engineer and Jie Ren, Research Scientist, Google Research    
Deep machine learning (ML) systems have achieved considerable success in medical image analysis in recent years. One major contributing factor is access to abundant labeled datasets, which are used to train highly effective supervised deep learning models. However, in the real-world, these models may encounter samples exhibiting rare conditions that are individually too infrequent for per-condition classification. Nevertheless, such conditions can be collectively common because they follow a long-tail distribution and when taken together can represent a significant portion of cases — e.g., in a recent deep learning dermatological study, hundreds of rare conditions composed around 20%…</span>

We’re excited to announce that operation and SRE teams can now take advantage of an official Elastic Stack Terraform provider to configure the Elastic Stack across all types of infrastructure, whether on Elastic Cloud, or on-premises and self-managed.
This Elastic Stack Terraform provider will allow you to fully control the configuration of Elasticsearch, Kibana, Fleet, and any other component within the Elastic Stack.
The Terraform provider helps you safely manage production-related infrastructure using methodologies like infrastructure as code, which allow you to apply peer-reviewed infrastructure changes in an automated and controlled fashion.

                    <span>Posted by Matt McEwen, Student Researcher, Google Quantum AI and Lara Faoro, Research Fellow, LPTHE- Sorbonne Université and CNRS (Paris) 
Quantum processors are made of superconducting quantum bits (qubits) that — being quantum objects — are highly susceptible to even tiny amounts of environmental noise. This noise can cause errors in quantum computation that need to be addressed to continue advancing quantum computers. Our Sycamore processors are installed in specially designed cryostats, where they are sealed away from stray light and electromagnetic fields and are cooled down to very low temperatures to reduce thermal noise.  
However, the world is full of high-energy radiation. In fact, there’s a tiny background of high-energy gamma rays and muons that pass through everything around u…</span>

As an instructor of other scuba diving instructors, Diane Tetrault knows how to convey life-saving lessons in a way that encourages and supports her students. And as it turns out, that skill is highly transferable to two other key roles in her life: manager and mother.
Diane is the Senior Director of Product Marketing at Elastic and is also a mom of two sons. In the water, at work, and with her family, she’s gotten plenty of practice creating the right environment for other people to learn and enjoy.
“Scuba diving is something lots of people have on their bucket list, where they say, ‘Oh, I wish I could do that, but I’m too afraid.’ But I know lots of people would love it if they tried.”
Diane’s not one to shy away from new experiences, even when it seems like they’d be hard to work into…</span>

Reunion dinner will be on the 31st of January, and the two weeks of celebration will begin. All that to say that this is my last real chance, speaking I’m sure for the entire Tanzu team, to wish everyone around the planet (billions of people!) who celebrates a very happy Lunar New Year (Mandarin: 新年快乐 (pronounced: xin nian kauai le ) / Cantonese: 新年快乐 (pronounced: san nin fai lok )) and to say that we hope you enjoy prosperity in the new year (Mandarin: 恭喜发财 (pronounced: gong xi fa cai) / Cantonese: 恭喜发财 (pronounced: gong hei fat choy))!

2022 is a year of ongoing transformation for financial services, as both brick-and-mortar firms and digital-native startups position themselves for a world in which digital interaction remains the default for customers, business partners, and even employees.
From an uncertain global  economy to the disruption of business activities and everyday life, Digital experiences have become the answer to shoring up the financial sector. 
That digital experience must start with offering secure, high-performing omnichannel touchpoints for every interaction. As we turn over into 2022, we are likely to see the following four trends remain top of mind for technology and business leaders across the sector.

Image matting is the process of extracting a precise alpha matte that separates foreground and background objects in an image. This technique has been traditionally used in the filmmaking and photography industry for image and video editing purposes, e.g., background replacement, synthetic bokeh and other visual effects. Image matting assumes that an image is a composite of foreground and background images, and hence, the intensity of each pixel is a linear combination of the foreground and the background.  
   
In the case of traditional image segmentation, the image is segmented in a binary manner, in which a pixel either belongs to the foreground or background. This type of segmentation, however, is unab…</span>

Birds are all around us, and just by listening, we can learn many things about our environment. Ecologists use birds to understand food systems and forest health — for example, if there are more woodpeckers in a forest, that means there’s a lot of dead wood. Because birds communicate and mark territory with songs and calls, it’s most efficient to identify them by ear. In fact, experts may identify up to 10x as many birds by ear as by sight. 
In recent years, autonomous recording units (ARUs) have made it easy to capture thousands of hours of audio in forests that could be used to better understand ecosystems and identify critical habitat. However, manually reviewing the audio data is very time co…</span>

We wanted to call out some great adjacent research from the team at Sophoslabs Uncut that was released on December 21, 2021. Research groups frequently analyze similar (or in this case, identical) campaigns through their own unique lens. This is fantastic for the security community, as the campaign gets more eyes and different perspectives applied towards the same problem.
Elastic researches exploits, vulnerabilities, and threats on an ongoing basis. Recently, we published research that covers the FORMBOOK campaign that steals information through a phishing campaign and takes advantage of the MSHTML exploit chain. While researching the FORMBOOK campaign, the Elastic Security Intelligence &amp; Analytics team found campaign phases as well as shared infrastructure through a tradecraft oversigh…</span>

Elasticsearch 7.15 introduces a new endpoint that generates vector tiles from geospatial data stored in Elasticsearch. This provides a new and much more efficient way to render geospatial data.
Building on developments over several years, Elasticsearch provides users with a mature technology to filter and aggregate geospatial data. Common to the geospatial use case, visualizing high volumes of geospatial data is still a challenging problem, particularly for applications that use map technologies on the front end. Before 7.15, the main pain points were:

Retrieving full geometries from Elasticsearch documents was inefficient, as maps don&#x27;t generally need the full resolution of all geo shapes 
GeoJSON is not the best technology to render high volumes of complex geospatial data

Language models are becoming more capable than ever before and are helpful in a variety of tasks — translating one language into another, summarizing a long document into a brief highlight, or answering information-seeking questions. Among these, open-domain dialog, where a model needs to be able to converse about any topic, is probably one of the most difficult, with a wide range of potential applications and open challenges. In addition to producing responses that humans judge as sensible, interesting, and specific to the context, dialog models should adhere to Responsible AI practices, and avoid making factual statements that are not supported by external …</span>

                    <span>On behalf of the team and everyone who has contributed, I’m happy to announce that Spring Boot 3.0.0-M1 has been released and is now available from https://repo.spring.io/milestone.

This milestone starts our exciting journey to the next generation of the Spring Framework and raises our baseline from Java 8 to Java 17. We are planning to release a new milestone of Spring Boot 3.0 every two months. M2 should arrive on March 24 and we are planning on a GA release in late November.

If you are trying an existing application with Spring Boot 3.0 you’ll need to be aware that we’ve migrated all Java EE APIs to their equivalent Jakarta EE variant. For most users, this means you’ll need to replace any javax imports with jakarta. For example, javax.servlet.Filter would be replaced with jakarta.servlet.Filter.

We’re still waiting for a few third-party libraries to release Jakarta EE compatible versions, so not all Spring Boot 2.x features are available with this first milestone. We plan to reintroduce features as and when libraries provide appropriate releases.

Please see the release notes for more details and upgrade instructions.

If you’re interested in trying this new release, you can easily generate a project from start.spring.io.
Thanks to all those who have contributed with issue reports and pull requests.

Elastic Security engineers have documented a less tedious way to find network beaconing from Cobalt Strike. In their full analysis ([1] [2]), Elastic Security team researchers Andrew Pease, Derek Ditch, and Daniel Stepanic walk users through the Elastic fleet policy, how to collect the beacon, beacon configuration, how to analyze its activity, and how you can set it up in your organization’s environment.
These two articles ([1] [2]) are ideal for helping security analysts identify, collect, and configure Cobalt Strike beacon payloads from an endpoint using Elastic. It is often difficult to collect the Cobalt Strike beacon payload from memory and extract its configuration to identify observables and cluster group activities, partially due to the tremendous amount of metadata the beacon’s configurations include.
The early stages of an intrusion usually include initial access, execution, persistence, and command-and-control (C2) beaconing. When structured threats use zero-days, these first two stages are often not detected, and it can often be challenging and time-consuming to identify persistence mechanisms left by an advanced adversary. 
The information helps threat hunters and analysts monitor Cobalt Strike beaconing activity, but also provides useful indicators of compromise (IoCs) with which to start an investigation.
If you don’t have an Elastic Cloud cluster but would like to collect and configure the Cobalt Strike beacon, you can start a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud today.</span>

                    <span>One finds limits by pushing them. –Herbert A. Simon,,,
At Elastic, we focus on bringing value to users through fast results that operate at scale and are relevant — speed, scale, and relevance are in our DNA. In Elasticsearch 7.16, we focused on scale, pushing the limits of Elasticsearch to make search even faster, memory less demanding, and clusters more stable. Along the way, we uncovered a range of dimensions on sharding and in the process sped up Elasticsearch to new heights. 
Historically, we’ve recommended avoiding creating a gazillion shards in your cluster due to the resource overhead involved. However, with the new data streams indexing strategy in Fleet, more and more smaller shards will be generated from security and observability use cases, so it’s essential that we find new wa…</span>

Elasticsearch 7.16 introduced a new enrich policy: range. The range policy allows one to match a number, date, or IP address in incoming documents to a range of the same type in the enrich index. Being able to match against an IP range can be specifically useful in security use cases where the additional metadata can be used to further refine detection rules. As we’ve already added an example to our documentation using IP ranges, we’ll go through an example here using the date_range type.
Our fictional example: incidents and on-call schedules
Say we have a number of on-call schedules and we want to add them to Elasticsearch so that each continuous shift is a document. Let’s introduce our fictional test cases: Bob, Alice, Dan, Matt and Lizzie.

In addition to that, as always, there was plenty of feedback leading to a number of refinements and fixes.

Elastic Security has verified a new destructive malware targeting Ukraine: Operation Bleeding Bear.
Over the weekend, Microsoft released details about this multi-stage and destructive malware campaign that the Ukrainian National Cyber Security Coordination Center has been referring to as Operation Bleeding Bear. 
Elastic users are fully protected from attacks like these through our advanced malware detection and Ransomware Protection capabilities, and the Elastic Security team continues to monitor these events. This case highlights the importance of prevention when it’s up against ransomware and malware with destructive capabilities.
In this full-length article, we break down the involved malware providing new insights and highlighting behaviors that can be used to help identify this activity.
Elastic Security researchers provide an overview of Operation Bleeding Bear, including how it wipes the Master Boot Record, uses tampering techniques such as disabling Windows Defender, leverages process hollowing, and corrupts files across the file system. We also outline defensive recommendations, specific Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) and a how-to-locate and remediate guide using Elastic Security and the MITRE ATT&amp;CK® framework — identifying malware components at each stage. 
Existing Elastic Security users can access these capabilities within the product. If you’re new to Elastic Security, take a look at our Quick Start guides (bite-sized training videos to get you started quickly). And you can always get started with a free 14-day trial of Elastic Cloud.</span>

                    <span>,Elastic can now seamlessly ingest data from Microsoft Azure Spring Cloud so DevOps and SREs can monitor their Spring Boot applications to increase operational efficiency and developer productivity. ,
Azure Spring Cloud is a fully managed service for Spring applications that simplifies infrastructure management. A 2021 survey from Microsoft indicated that “end-to-end monitoring” is the second biggest challenge DevOps and IT managers face as they migrate Spring Boot applications to the cloud.
Now DevOps and SREs can monitor both Spring Boot logs and application metrics across all environments by automatically shipping them to Elastic. Teams can also correlate and add context to their observability data from Spring Boot applications with other observability data sets across their environment…</span>

Neural networks can perform certain tasks remarkably well, but understanding how they reach their decisions — e.g., identifying which signals in an image cause a model to determine it to be of one class and not another —  is often a mystery. Explaining a neural model’s decision process may have high social impact in certain areas, such as analysis of medical images and autonomous driving, where human oversight is critical. These insights can also be helpful in guiding health care providers, revealing model biases, providing support for downstream decision makers, and even aiding scientific discovery. 
Previous approaches for visual explanations of classifiers, such as attention maps (e.g., Grad-CAM), highlight whic…</span>

                    <span>Hi, Spring fans! Welcome to another jam-packed, fun-filled, rock’em sock’em installment of This Week in Spring! It’s the 18th of January and I’m feelin’ great because I just got back from a three-day weekend. Here in the US, we celebrated on Monday the life of the good Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights activist who advanced the plight of African American civil rights. Dr. King is another one of my favorite doctors, along with Drs. Syer, Strange, Who, Subramaniam, and Pollack.

How’re you? We’ve got a lot to cover so let’s get to it!

                    <span>Azure DevOps Server 2019 and 2020 use two different models for retaining builds. In Azure DevOps Server 2019, users configure retention settings for each pipeline. Organization-level defaults are applied if a pipeline is not explicitly configured for retention. Builds that are retained indefinitely or by releases are marked and handled using a common bit in the build record.

This initial 3.0 milestone contains 13 enhancements, documentation improvements, and dependency upgrades. It covers the baseline upgrade efforts, in particular requiring JDK 17 and Spring Framework 6 and migrating to the Jakarta EE 9 APIs as announced in this blog post.

Please note that support for REST Assured has been removed temporarily as it is not yet compatible with Jakarta EE 9. We hope to reinstate support in a subsequent milestone prior to 3.0’s release towards the end of this year.

Scaling large language models has resulted in significant quality improvements in natural language understanding (T5), generation (GPT-3) and multilingual neural machine translation (M4). One common approach to building a larger model is to increase the depth (number of layers) and width (layer dimensionality), simply enlarging existing dimensions of the network. Such dense models take an input sequence (divided into smaller components, called tokens) and pass every token through the full network, activating every layer and parameter. While these large, dense models have achieved state-of-the-art results on multiple natural language processing (NLP) tasks, their training cost incre…</span>

2021.x vs. 2022.x

You might now ask why is there a new release in the calver 2021.x version and why is there already a 2022.x release?

In parallel to working on Spring Data 3.x, aka 2022.0.0, we continue to invest in the support of the Spring Data 2.x development line. We already expect Spring Data 2.7 and 2.8 releases. So, if you want to continue using Spring Boot 2 for an extended period of time, stick to the 2021.x release trains (which are based on Spring Framework 5.3 and Java 8). That’s the reason we chose to continue with calver 2021.x, which, hopefully, makes understanding version compatibilities easie…</span>

Advances in deep learning over the last few decades have been driven by a few key elements. With a small number of simple but flexible mechanisms (i.e., inductive biases such as convolutions or sequence attention), increasingly large datasets, and more specialized hardware, neural networks can now achieve impressive results on a wide range of tasks, such as image classification, machine translation, and protein folding prediction. 
However, the use of large models and datasets comes at the expense of significant computational requirements. Yet, recent works suggest that large model sizes might be necessary for strong generalization and robustness, so training large models whil…</span>

                    <span>Posted by Jeff Dean, Senior Fellow and SVP of Google Research, on behalf of the entire Google Research community
Over the last several decades, I&#x27;ve witnessed a lot of change in the fields of machine learning (ML) and computer science. Early approaches, which often fell short, eventually gave rise to modern approaches that have been very successful. Following that long-arc pattern of progress, I think we&#x27;ll see a number of exciting advances over the next several years, advances that will ultimately benefit the lives of billions of people with greater impact than ever before. In this post, I’ll highlight five areas where ML is poised to have such impact. For each, I’ll discuss related research (mostly from 2021) and the directions and progress we’ll likely see in the next few years.
